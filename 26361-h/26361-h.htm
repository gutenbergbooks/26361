<p class="pin">This Revised Testament has been prepared under the
auspices of the American Bible Union, by the most competent
scholars of the day. No expense has been spared to obtain the
oldest translations of the Bible, copies of the ancient
manuscripts, and other facilities to make the revision as perfect
as possible.</p>
<p class="pin">The paragraph form has been adopted in preference to
the division by verse, which is a modern mode of division, never
used in the ancient scriptures. But, for convenience of reference,
the numbers of the verses are retained.</p>
<p class="pin">All quotations from the Old Testament are distinctly
indicated, and the poetic form is restored to those which appear as
poetry in the original.</p>
<p class="pis">The revisers have been guided in their labors by the
following rules prescribed by the Union:</p>
<p style=

RULES FOR THE REVISION OF THE ENGLISH NEW TESTAMENT.</p>
<div style="font-size:12pt">
<p class="pin">The received Greek text, critically edited, with
known errors corrected, must be followed.</p>
<p class="pin">The common English version must be the basis of
revision, and only such alterations must be made as the exact
meaning of the text and the existing state of the language may
require.</p>
<p class="pin">The exact meaning of the inspired text, as that text
expressed it to those who understood the original Scriptures at the
time they were first written, must be given in corresponding words
and phrases, so far as they can be found in the English language,
with the least possible obscurity or indefiniteness.</p>

MATTHEW.</a></h1>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class=
"sc">ook</span> of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David,
son of Abraham. <sup>2</sup>Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot
Jacob; and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers; <sup>3</sup>and
Judah begot Pharez and Zarah, of Tamar; and Pharez begot Hezron;
and Hezron begot Ram; <sup>4</sup>and Ram begot Amminadab; and
Amminadab begot Nahshon; and Nahshon begot Salmon; <sup>5</sup>and
Salmon begot Boaz, of Rahab; and Boaz begot Obed, of Ruth; and Obed
begot Jesse; <sup>6</sup>and Jesse begot David the king; and David
begot Solomon, of the wife of Uriah; <sup>7</sup>and Solomon begot
Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begot Abijah; and Abijah begot Asa;
<sup>8</sup>and Asa begot Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begot Joram;
and Joram begot Uzziah; <sup>9</sup>and Uzziah begot Jotham; and
Jotham begot Ahaz; and Ahaz begot Hezekiah; <sup>10</sup>and
Hezekiah begot Manasseh; and Manasseh begot Amon; and Amon begot
Josiah; <sup>11</sup>and Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers, at
the time of the removal to Babylon. <sup>12</sup>And after the
removal to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel; and Salathiel begot
Zerubbabel; <sup>13</sup>and Zerubbabel begot Abiud; and Abiud
begot Eliakim; and Eliakim begot Azor; <sup>14</sup>and Azor begot
Zadock; and Zadock begot Achim; and Achim begot Eliud;
<sup>15</sup>and Eliud begot Eleazar; and Eleazar begot Matthan;
and Matthan begot Jacob; <sup>16</sup>and Jacob begot Joseph the
husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>All the generations, therefore, from
Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto
the removal to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the removal
to Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was after
this manner. His mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph,
before they came together she was found with child by the Holy
Spirit. <sup>19</sup>And Joseph her husband, being just, and not
willing to expose her openly<sup><a href="#r400119" id="f400119"
title="see footnote" name="f400119">19</a></sup>, desired to put
her away privately. <sup>20</sup>But while he thought on these
things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,
saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy
wife; for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
<sup>21</sup>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call
his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And all this has come to pass, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying:</p>
<p class="pp3"><sup>23</sup>Behold, the virgin shall be with
child,</p>
<p class="pp3">And shall bring forth a son,</p>
<p class="pp3">And they shall call his name Immanuel;</p>
<p class="pnn">which is interpreted<sup><a href="#r400123" id=
"f400123" title="see footnote" name="f400123">23</a></sup>, God
with us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And Joseph, awaking from sleep, did as
the angel of the Lord bade him, and took to him his wife;
<sup>25</sup>and he knew her not till she brought forth a
son<sup><a href="#r400125" id="f400125" title="see footnote" name=
"f400125">25</a></sup>; and he called his name Jesus.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> Jesus
having been born in Bethlehem of Jud&aelig;a, in the days of Herod
the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
<sup>2</sup>saying: Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For
we saw his star in the east, and came to do him homage.
<sup>3</sup>And the king, Herod, hearing it, was troubled, and all
Jerusalem with him. <sup>4</sup>And having assembled all the chief
priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the
Christ should be born. <sup>5</sup>And they said to him: In
Bethlehem of Jud&aelig;a; for thus it is written by the
prophet:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>6</sup>And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah,</p>
<p class="pp1">Art by no means least among the princes of
Judah;</p>
<p class="pp1">For out of thee shall come forth a Governor,</p>
<p class="pp1">Who shall rule my people Israel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Then Herod, having secretly called the
wise men, inquired of them exactly the time of the appearing of the
star. <sup>8</sup>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said: Go and
inquire strictly concerning the child; and when ye have found him,
bring me word again, that I also may come and do him homage.
<sup>9</sup>And they, having heard the king, departed; and lo, the
star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came
and stood over where the child was. <sup>10</sup>And seeing the
star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. <sup>11</sup>And
coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and
fell down, and did homage to him; and opening their treasures, they
presented to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
<sup>12</sup>And being warned by God in a dream, not to return to
Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And when they had departed, behold, an
angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying: Arise, and
take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there
until I bring thee word; for Herod is about to seek the child to
destroy him. <sup>14</sup>And he arose and took the child and his
mother by night and departed into Egypt, <sup>15</sup>and was there
until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: <span class=
"ot">Out of Egypt I called my son.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked
by the wise men, was exceedingly enraged; and he sent forth, and
slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its
borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which
he had exactly learned from the wise men. <sup>17</sup>Then was
fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet,
saying:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>18</sup>A voice was heard in Ramah,</p>
<p class="pp1">Weeping, and great mourning<sup><a href="#r400218"
id="f400218" title="see footnote" name="f400218">18</a></sup>;</p>
<p class="pp1">Rachel weeping for her children,</p>
<p class="pp1">And would not be comforted, because they are
not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>But when Herod was dead, behold, an
angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
<sup>20</sup>saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and
go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the
child's life. <sup>21</sup>And he arose, and took the child and his
mother, and came into the land of Israel. <sup>22</sup>But hearing
that Archelaus reigned in Jud&aelig;a instead of Herod his father,
he was afraid to go thither; and being warned by God in a dream, he
retired into the region of Galilee. <sup>23</sup>And he came and
dwelt in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken through the prophets: <span class="ot">He shall be
called a Nazarene.</span></p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I<span class="sc">n</span> those days
comes John the Immerser, preaching in the wilderness of
Jud&aelig;a, <sup>2</sup>and saying: Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand. <sup>3</sup>For this is he that was spoken of
through the prophet Isaiah, saying:</p>
<p class="pp2">The voice of one crying in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="pp2">Prepare the way of the Lord,</p>
<p class="pp2">Make straight his paths.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>4</sup>And he, John, had his raiment of camel's
hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was
locusts and wild honey.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all
Jud&aelig;a, and all the region about the Jordan; <sup>6</sup>and
they were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
<sup>7</sup>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming
to his immersion, he said to them: Brood of vipers, who warned you
to flee from the coming wrath? <sup>8</sup>Bring forth therefore
fruit worthy of repentance; <sup>9</sup>and think not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that
God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
<sup>10</sup>And already the axe is laid to the root of the trees;
therefore every tree that brings not forth good fruit is cut down,
and cast into the fire. <sup>11</sup>I indeed immerse you in water
unto repentance; but he that comes after me is mightier than I,
whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; he will immerse you in the
Holy Spirit and fire; <sup>12</sup>whose fan is in his hand, and he
will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and will gather his
wheat into the garner; but the chaff he will burn up with fire
unquenchable.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the
Jordan, to John, to be immersed by him. <sup>14</sup>But John
sought to hinder him, saying: I have need to be immersed by thee,
and dost thou come to me? <sup>15</sup>And Jesus answering said to
him: Suffer it now; for thus it becomes us to fulfill all
righteousness. Then he suffered him. <sup>16</sup>And having been
immersed, Jesus went up immediately from the water; and lo, the
heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God
descending, as a dove, and coming upon him. <sup>17</sup>And lo, a
voice out of heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">hen</span> Jesus was
led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the
Devil. <sup>2</sup>And having fasted forty days and forty nights,
he afterwards hungered. <sup>3</sup>And coming to him, the tempter
said: If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become
loaves of bread. <sup>4</sup>But he answering said: It is written,
<span class="ot">Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every
word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Then the Devil takes him into the holy
city, and sets him on the pinnacle of the temple, <sup>6</sup>and
says to him: If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it
is written:</p>
<p class="pp1">He will give his angels command concerning thee;</p>
<p class="pp1">And on their hands they will bear thee up,</p>
<p class="pp1">Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>7</sup>Jesus said to him: Again it is written,
<span class="ot">Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Again the Devil takes him into an
exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the
world, and the glory of them; <sup>9</sup>and says to him: All
these things I will give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship
me. <sup>10</sup>Then Jesus says to him: Get thee hence, Satan; for
it is written: <span class="ot">Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span> <sup>11</sup>Then the
Devil leaves him; and behold, angels came and ministered to
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And hearing that John was delivered up,
he retired into Galilee. <sup>13</sup>And leaving Nazareth, he came
and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of
Zebulun and Naphtali; <sup>14</sup>that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>15</sup>The land of Zebulun, and the land of
Naphtali,</p>
<p class="pp1">By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,</p>
<p class="pp1">Galilee of the Gentiles,</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>16</sup>The people that sat in darkness, saw
great light,</p>
<p class="pp1">And to those sitting in the region and shadow of
death light sprang up.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>From that time Jesus began to preach,
and to say: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
<sup>18</sup>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two
brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net
into the sea; for they were fishermen. <sup>19</sup>And he says to
them: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
<sup>20</sup>And they, immediately leaving the nets, followed him.
<sup>21</sup>And going on from thence, he saw other two brothers,
James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with
Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
<sup>22</sup>And they, immediately leaving the ship and their
father, followed him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And Jesus went about all Galilee,
teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the
kingdom, and healing every sickness and every infirmity among the
people. <sup>24</sup>And his fame went forth into all Syria; and
they brought to him all that were sick, taken with divers diseases
and torments, and possessed with demons, and lunatic, and palsied;
and he healed them. <sup>25</sup>And great multitudes followed him
from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Jud&aelig;a, and
from beyond the Jordan.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=
"sc">nd</span> seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain;
and he having sat down, his disciples came to him. <sup>2</sup>And
he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying:</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Happy the poor in spirit; for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Happy they that mourn; for they shall be
comforted.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Happy the meek; for they shall inherit
the earth<sup><a href="#r400505" id="f400505" title="see footnote"
name="f400505">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Happy they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness; for they shall be filled.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Happy the merciful; for they shall
obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Happy the pure in heart; for they shall
see God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Happy the peacemakers; for they shall be
called sons of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Happy they who are persecuted for
righteousness' sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Happy are ye, when they shall revile
and persecute you, and shall say all evil against you
falsely<sup><a href="#r400511" id="f400511" title="see footnote"
name="f400511">11</a></sup>, for my sake. <sup>12</sup>Rejoice, and
exult; because great is your reward in heaven, for so they
persecuted the prophets that were before you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Ye are the salt of the earth; but if
the salt become tasteless, wherewith shall it be salted? It is
thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden
under foot by men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Ye are the light of the world. A city
that is set on a hill can not be hid. <sup>15</sup>Nor do they
light a lamp and put it under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand;
and it shines to all that are in the house. <sup>16</sup>Thus let
your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
glorify your Father who is in heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Think not that I came to destroy the
law, or the prophets; I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.
<sup>18</sup>For verily I say to you, till heaven and earth pass,
one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law, till all be
fulfilled. <sup>19</sup>Whoever therefore shall break one of these
least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called the
least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever shall do and teach
them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>For I say to you, that except your
righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Ye heard that it was said to
those<sup><a href="#r400521" id="f400521" title="see footnote"
name="f400521">21</a></sup> of old: <span class="ot">Thou shalt not
kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
judgment.</span> <sup>22</sup>But I say to you, that every one who
is angry with his brother, without cause<sup><a href="#r400522a"
id="f400522a" title="see footnote" name="f400522a">22a</a></sup>,
shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his
brother, Raca<sup><a href="#r400522b" id="f400522b" title=
"see footnote" name="f400522b">22b</a></sup>! shall be in danger of
the council; and whoever shall say, Thou fool! shall be in danger
of hell-fire. <sup>23</sup>Therefore if thou bringest thy gift to
the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother has aught against
thee; <sup>24</sup>leave there thy gift before the altar, and go,
first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy
gift.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Agree with thine adversary quickly,
while thou art in the way with him; lest haply the adversary
deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the
officer, and thou be cast into prison. <sup>26</sup>Verily I say to
thee, thou shalt not come out thence, till thou hast paid the
uttermost farthing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Ye heard that it was said: <span class=
"ot">Thou shalt not commit adultery.</span> <sup>28</sup>But I say
to you, that every one who looks on a woman, to lust after her, has
already committed adultery with her in his heart. <sup>29</sup>And
if thy right eye causes thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it
from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members
perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. <sup>30</sup>And
if thy right hand causes thee to offend, cut it off and cast it
from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members
perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And it was said: <span class=
"ot">Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of
divorcement.</span> <sup>32</sup>But I say to you, that whoever
shall put away his wife, save for the cause of fornication, makes
her commit adultery; and whoever shall marry her when put away,
commits adultery.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Again ye heard, that it was said to
those of old<sup><a href="#r400533" id="f400533" title=
"see footnote" name="f400533">33</a></sup>: <span class="ot">Thou
shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform to the Lord thine
oaths.</span> <sup>34</sup>But I say to you, swear not at all;
neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup>35</sup>nor by the
earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the
city of the great King. <sup>36</sup>Nor shalt thou swear by thy
head; because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
<sup>37</sup>But let your word be, Yea, yea, Nay, nay; for that
which is more than these comes of evil.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>Ye heard that it was said: <span class=
"ot">An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</span>
<sup>39</sup>But I say to you, that ye resist not evil; but whoever
shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
<sup>40</sup>And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take thy
coat, let him have thy cloak also. <sup>41</sup>And whoever shall
compel thee to go one mile, go with him two. <sup>42</sup>Give to
him that asks of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn
not away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>Ye heard that it was said: <span class=
"ot">Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and shalt hate thine
enemy.</span> <sup>44</sup>But I say to you, love your enemies, and
pray for those who persecute you; <sup>45</sup>that ye may be sons
of your Father who is in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on
the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
<sup>46</sup>For if ye love those who love you, what reward have
ye? Do not also the publicans the same? <sup>47</sup>And if ye
salute your brethren only, what do ye that excels? Do not also the
heathen thus? <sup>48</sup>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
Father who is in heaven is perfect.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">ake</span> heed that
ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen by them;
otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
<sup>2</sup>Therefore when thou doest alms, do not sound a trumpet
before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say to you, they
have in full their reward. <sup>3</sup>But when thou doest alms,
let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does;
<sup>4</sup>that thine aims may be in secret and thy Father who
sees in secret will himself reward thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the
hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Verily I
say to you, they have in full their reward. <sup>6</sup>But thou,
when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and having shut thy door,
pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who sees in
secret will reward thee.</p>
<p class="pis"><sup>7</sup>But when ye pray, use not vain
repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be
heard for their much speaking. <sup>8</sup>Be not ye therefore like
to them; for your Father knows what things ye have need of, before
ye ask him. <sup>9</sup>Do ye, therefore, pray after this
manner:</p>
<p class="pin">Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy
name.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, as
in heaven, so also on the earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Give us this day our daily
bread<sup><a href="#r400611" id="f400611" title="see footnote"
name="f400611">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And forgive us our debts, as also we
forgave our debtors.</p>
<p class="pis"><sup>13</sup>And bring us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil<sup><a href="#r400613" id="f400613" title=

<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>For if ye forgive men their trespasses,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you; <sup>15</sup>but if ye
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive
your trespasses.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And when ye fast, be not as the
hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces,
that they may appear to men to fast. Verily I say to you, they have
in full their reward. <sup>17</sup>But thou, when thou fastest,
anoint thy head, and wash thy face; <sup>18</sup>that thou appear
not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy
Father who sees in secret will reward thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Lay not up for yourselves treasures on
the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break
through and steal. <sup>20</sup>But lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves
do not break through nor steal. <sup>21</sup>For where your
treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>The lamp of the body is the eye. If
therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light;
<sup>23</sup>but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body will be dark.
If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness, how great the
darkness! <sup>24</sup>No man can serve two masters; for either he
will hate the one, and love the other, or he will hold to one and
despise the other. Ye can not serve God and Mammon.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>For this cause I say to you, take not
thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;
nor for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than
food, and the body than raiment? <sup>26</sup>Behold the birds of
the air, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barns; and
your heavenly Father feeds them. Are ye not much better than they?
<sup>27</sup>And which of you by taking thought can add one cubit
to his stature<sup><a href="#r400627" id="f400627" title=
"see footnote" name="f400627">27</a></sup>? <sup>28</sup>And why
take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how
they grow. They toil not, nor spin; <sup>29</sup>and I say to you,
that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. <sup>30</sup>And if God so clothes the grass of the field,
which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, will he not
much more you, ye of little faith? <sup>31</sup>Take not thought
therefore, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or,
Wherewith shall we be clothed? <sup>32</sup>For after all these do
the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that ye have need
of all these. <sup>33</sup>But seek first the kingdom of God, and
his righteousness; and all these shall be added to you.
<sup>34</sup>Take not thought, therefore, for the morrow; for the
morrow will take thought for itself. Sufficient for the day is the
evil thereof.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;J<span class="sc">udge</span> not,
that ye be not judged. <sup>2</sup>For with what judgment ye judge,
ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be
measured to you. <sup>3</sup>And why beholdest thou the mote that
is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in
thine own eye? <sup>4</sup>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let
me cast out the mote from thine eye; and behold, the beam is in
thine own eye? <sup>5</sup>Hypocrite! first cast out the beam out
of thine own eye; and then thou wilt see clearly to cast out the
mote out of thy brother's eye.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Give not that which is holy to the dogs,
nor cast your pearls before the swine; lest they trample them with
their feet, and turn and rend you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek,
and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
<sup>8</sup>For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks
finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened. <sup>9</sup>Or
what man is there of you, of whom if his son ask bread, will he
give him a stone? <sup>10</sup>And if he ask a fish, will he give
him a serpent? <sup>11</sup>If ye then, being evil, know how to
give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father
who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
<sup>12</sup>Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should
do to you, so also do ye to them; for this is the law and the
prophets.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Enter in through the strait gate;
because wide is the gate, and broad the way, that leads to
destruction, and many are they who go in thereat.
<sup>14</sup><sup><a href="#r400714" id="f400714" title=

gate, and narrow the way, that leads to life, and few are they who
find it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Beware of false prophets, who come to
you in sheeps' clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Ye shall know them from their fruits.
Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
<sup>17</sup>So every good tree brings forth good fruit; but the
corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit. <sup>18</sup>A good tree can
not bring forth evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree bring forth good
fruit. <sup>19</sup>Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is
cut down, and cast into the fire. <sup>20</sup>So then, from their
fruits ye shall know them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Not every one that says to me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the
will of my Father who is in heaven. <sup>22</sup>Many will say to
me in that day: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in thy name, and in
thy name cast out demons, and in thy name do many miracles?
<sup>23</sup>And then will I profess to them, I never knew you;
depart from me, ye who work iniquity.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Every one, therefore, who hears these
sayings of mine<sup><a href="#r400724" id="f400724" title=
"see footnote" name="f400724">24</a></sup>, and does them, I will
liken him to a wise man, who built his house on the rock.
<sup>25</sup>And the rain descended, and the streams came, and the
winds blew, and fell upon that house; and it did not fall, for it
had been founded on the rock. <sup>26</sup>And every one who hears
these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a
foolish man, who built his house on the sand. <sup>27</sup>And the
rain descended, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and beat
upon that house, and it fell; and great was the fall of it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And it came to pass, when Jesus ended
these sayings, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching.
<sup>29</sup>For he taught them as having authority, and not as the
scribes.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">hen</span> he had
come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
<sup>2</sup>And, behold, there came a leper and bowed down to him,
saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me. <sup>3</sup>And
stretching forth his hand, he touched him, saying: I will; be thou
cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. <sup>4</sup>And
Jesus says to him: See thou tell no one; but go, show thyself to
the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a
testimony to them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And as he entered into Capernaum, there
came to him a centurion, beseeching him, <sup>6</sup>and saying:
Lord, my servant lies at home palsied, grievously tormented.
<sup>7</sup>And Jesus says to him: I will come and heal him.
<sup>8</sup>The centurion answered and said: Lord, I am not worthy
that thou shouldst come under my roof; but only say in a word, and
my servant will be healed. <sup>9</sup>For I am a man under
authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, Go, and
he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do
this, and he does it. <sup>10</sup>And Jesus hearing it marveled,
and said to those who followed: Verily I say to you, I found not so
great faith, even in Israel. <sup>11</sup>And I say to you, that
many will come from the east and west, and will recline at table,
with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;
<sup>12</sup>but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the
outer darkness. There will be the weeping, and the gnashing of
teeth! <sup>13</sup>And Jesus said to the centurion: Go thy way;
and as thou didst believe, be it done to thee. And his servant was
healed in that hour.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And Jesus, coming into the house of
Peter, saw his mother-in-law lying, and sick with fever.
<sup>15</sup>And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and
she arose, and ministered to him. <sup>16</sup>When evening was
come, they brought to him many that were possessed with demons; and
he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick;
<sup>17</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through
Isaiah the prophet, saying: &nbsp;<span class="ot">Himself took our
infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And Jesus, seeing great multitudes
about him, commanded to depart to the other side. <sup>19</sup>And
a certain scribe came, and said to him: Teacher, I will follow thee
whithersoever thou goest. <sup>20</sup>And Jesus says to him: The
foxes have holes and the birds of the air nests; but the Son of man
has not where he may lay his head. <sup>21</sup>And another of his
disciples said to him: Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my
father. <sup>22</sup>But Jesus said to him: Follow me, and let the
dead bury their own dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And when he had entered into the ship,
his disciples followed him. <sup>24</sup>And, behold, there arose a
great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered by the
waves; but he was sleeping. <sup>25</sup>And the disciples came and
awoke him, saying: Lord, save us; we perish. <sup>26</sup>And he
says to them: Why are ye fearful, ye of little faith? Then rising,
he rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
<sup>27</sup>And the men marveled, saying: What manner of man is
this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And when he had come to the other side,
into the country of the Gadarenes<sup><a href="#r400828" id=
"f400828" title="see footnote" name="f400828">28</a></sup>, there
met him two possessed with demons, coming out of the tombs,
exceedingly fierce, so that no one was able to pass by that way.
<sup>29</sup>And, behold, they cried out, saying: What have we to
do with thee, Son of God? Camest thou hither to torment us before
the time? <sup>30</sup>And there was afar off from them a herd of
many swine feeding. And the demons besought him, saying:
<sup>31</sup>If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of
swine. <sup>32</sup>And he said to them, Go. And they, coming out,
went away into the swine; and, behold, the whole herd rushed down
the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.
<sup>33</sup>And the herdsmen fled, and went away into the city,
and told every thing, and what had befallen the possessed with
demons. <sup>34</sup>And, behold, all the city came out to meet
Jesus; and seeing him, they besought that he would depart from
their borders.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> entering
into the ship he passed over, and came to his own city.
<sup>2</sup>And, behold, they brought to him one that was palsied,
lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the palsied
man: Child, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven.
<sup>3</sup>And, behold, certain of the scribes said within
themselves: This man blasphemes. <sup>4</sup>And Jesus knowing
their thoughts said: Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
<sup>5</sup>For which is easier, to say: Thy sins are forgiven; or
to say: Arise, and walk? <sup>6</sup>But that ye may know that the
Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then says he to the
palsied man) Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thy house.
<sup>7</sup>And rising up he departed to his house. <sup>8</sup>And
seeing it the multitudes feared, and glorified God, who gave such
power to men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And Jesus, passing on from thence, saw a
man named Matthew, sitting at the place of receiving custom; and he
says to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.
<sup>10</sup>And it came to pass that, as he reclined at table in
the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and reclined at
table with Jesus and his disciples. <sup>11</sup>And the Pharisees,
seeing it, said to his disciples: Why does your teacher eat with
the publicans and the sinners? <sup>12</sup>And Jesus hearing it,
said: They who are well need not a physician, but they who are
sick. <sup>13</sup>But go, and learn what this means: I desire
mercy and not sacrifice; for I came not to call righteous men, but
sinners.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Then come to him the disciples of John,
saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples
fast not? <sup>15</sup>And Jesus said to them: Can the sons of the
bridechamber mourn<sup><a href="#r400915" id="f400915" title=
"see footnote" name="f400915">15</a></sup>, so long as the
bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom
will be taken from them, and then they will fast. <sup>16</sup>And
no one puts a piece of unfulled cloth on an old garment; for that
which fills it up takes from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
<sup>17</sup>Nor do they put new wine into old skins; else the
skins burst, and the wine runs out, and the skins are destroyed.
But they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved
together.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>While he was speaking these things to
them, behold, there came a ruler, and bowed down to him, saying: My
daughter just now died; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she
will live. <sup>19</sup>And Jesus arose and was following him, he
and his disciples. <sup>20</sup>And behold, a woman, having a flow
of blood twelve years, came behind, and touched the fringe of his
garment. <sup>21</sup>For she said within herself: If I only touch
his garment, I shall be made whole. <sup>22</sup>And Jesus, turning
and seeing her, said: Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith has
made thee whole. <sup>23</sup>And the woman was made whole from
that hour. And Jesus, coming into the house of the ruler, and
seeing the minstrels and the crowd making a noise,
<sup>24</sup>said: Give place; for the maiden is not dead, but is
sleeping. And they laughed him to scorn. <sup>25</sup>But when the
crowd was put forth, he went in, and took hold of her hand, and the
maiden arose. <sup>26</sup>And this report went abroad into all
that land.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And as Jesus passed on from thence, two
blind men followed him, crying, and saying: Have mercy on us, Son
of David. <sup>28</sup>And when he had come into the house, the
blind men came to him. And Jesus says to them: Believe ye that I am
able to do this? They say to him: Yea, Lord. <sup>29</sup>Then he
touched their eyes, saying: According to your faith be it done to
you. <sup>30</sup>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly
charged them, saying: Take heed, let no one know it.
<sup>31</sup>But they, going out, spread abroad his fame in all
that country.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And as they were going out, behold,
they brought to him a man dumb, possessed with a demon.
<sup>33</sup>And the demon being cast out, the dumb spoke. And the
multitudes marveled, saying: It was never so seen in Israel.
<sup>34</sup>But the Pharisees said: He casts out the demons
through the prince of the demons.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And Jesus went about all the cities and
villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news
of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every infirmity.
<sup>36</sup>And seeing the multitudes, he was moved with
compassion for them, because they were harassed, and
scattered<sup><a href="#r400936" id="f400936" title="see footnote"
name="f400936">36</a></sup>, as sheep having no shepherd.
<sup>37</sup>Then he says to his disciples: The harvest indeed is
great, but the laborers are few. <sup>38</sup>Pray therefore the
Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his
harvest.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=
"sc">nd</span> calling to him his twelve disciples, he gave them
authority over unclean spirits, so as to cast them out, and to heal
every sickness and every infirmity.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And the names of the twelve apostles are
these; first Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother;
James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; <sup>3</sup>Philip,
and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of
Alpheus, and Lebbeus surnamed Thaddeus; <sup>4</sup>Simon the
Cananite<sup><a href="#r401004" id="f401004" title="see footnote"
name="f401004">4</a></sup>, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>These twelve Jesus sent forth, and
charged them, saying: Go not into the way to the Gentiles, and into
a city of Samaritans enter not. <sup>6</sup>But go rather to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel. <sup>7</sup>And as ye go,
preach, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand. <sup>8</sup>Heal
the sick, raise the dead<sup><a href="#r401008" id="f401008" title=
"see footnote" name="f401008">8</a></sup>, cleanse lepers, cast out
demons. Freely ye received, freely give. <sup>9</sup>Provide not
gold, nor silver, nor brass in your girdles; <sup>10</sup>nor bag
for the journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor staff; for the
laborer is worthy of his living. <sup>11</sup>And into whatever
city or village ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and
there abide till ye go thence. <sup>12</sup>But when ye come into
the house, salute it. <sup>13</sup>And if the house be worthy, let
your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace
return to you. <sup>14</sup>And whoever shall not receive you, nor
hear your words, when ye go out of that house or city, shake off
the dust of your feet. <sup>15</sup>Verily I say to you, it shall
be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment, than for that city.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in
the midst of wolves; be therefore wise as serpents, and simple as
doves. <sup>17</sup>But beware of men; for they will deliver you up
to councils, and will scourge you in their synagogues;
<sup>18</sup>and before governors also and kings will ye be brought
for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>But when they deliver you up, take not
thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in
that hour what ye shall speak. <sup>20</sup>For it is not ye that
speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And the brother will deliver up the
brother to death, and the father the child; and children will rise
up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
<sup>22</sup>And ye will be hated by all, for my name's sake; but
he that has endured to the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>But when they persecute you in this
city, flee into the other; for verily I say to you, ye shall not
have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>A disciple is not above the teacher,
nor a servant above his lord. <sup>25</sup>It is enough for the
disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord: If
they called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those
of his household!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>Fear them not therefore; for there is
nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and hid that shall not
be known. <sup>27</sup>What I say to you in the darkness, that
speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, that proclaim
upon the house-tops. <sup>28</sup>And be not afraid of those who
kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear
him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
<sup>30</sup>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
<sup>31</sup>Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many
sparrows.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>Every one, therefore, who shall
acknowledge me before men, him will I also acknowledge before my
Father who is in heaven. <sup>33</sup>But whoever shall deny me
before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in
heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>Think not that I came to send peace on
the earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword. <sup>35</sup>For
I came to set a man at variance with his father, and a daughter
with her mother, and a bride with her mother-in-law;
<sup>36</sup>and a man's foes will be they of his household.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>He that loves father or mother more
than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loves son or daughter
more than me, is not worthy of me. <sup>38</sup>And he that does
not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
<sup>39</sup>He that finds his life shall lose it; and he that

<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>He that receives you receives me; and
he that receives me receives him who sent me. <sup>41</sup>He that
receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a
prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name
of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
<sup>42</sup>And whoever shall give to drink a cup of cold water
only to one of these little ones, in the name of a disciple, verily
I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> it came to
pass, when Jesus made an end of commanding his twelve disciples,
that he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And John, having heard in the prison the
works of the Christ, sent by his disciples, <sup>3</sup>and said to
him: Art thou he that comes, or look we for another?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And Jesus answering said to them: Go and
report to John what ye hear and see. <sup>5</sup>The blind receive
sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the
dead are raised, and to the poor good tidings are published.
<sup>6</sup>And happy is he, whoever shall not be offended at
me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And as these were departing, Jesus began
to say to the multitudes concerning John: What went ye out into the
wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>But what went ye out to see? A man
clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who wear soft clothing are in
king's houses.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>But what went ye out to see? A
prophet<sup><a href="#r401109" id="f401109" title="see footnote"
name="f401109">9</a></sup>? Yea, I say to you, and more than a
prophet. <sup>10</sup>For this is he of whom it is written:</p>
<p class="pp2">Behold, I send forth my messenger before thy
face,</p>
<p class="pp2">Who shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>11</sup>Verily I say to you, among those born
of women, there has not risen a greater than John the Immerser. But
he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And from the days of John the Immerser
until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent
seize upon it. <sup>13</sup>For all the prophets and the law
prophesied until John. <sup>14</sup>And if ye are willing to
receive it, he is the Elijah that should come. <sup>15</sup>He that
has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>But to what shall I liken this
generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, who call
to their fellows, <sup>17</sup>and say: We piped to you, and ye
danced not; we sang the lament, and ye did not beat the breast.
<sup>18</sup>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they
say: He has a demon. <sup>19</sup>The Son of man came eating and
drinking, and they say: Behold a glutton and a wine-drinker, a
friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom was justified on the
part of her children.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Then began he to upbraid the cities
wherein most of his miracles were done, because they repented not.
<sup>21</sup>Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee, Bethsaida! For if
the miracles, that were done in you, had been done in Tyre and
Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
<sup>22</sup>But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre
and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And thou, Capernaum, <sup><a href=
"#r401123a" id="f401123a" title="see footnote" name=
"f401123a">23a</a></sup>that wast exalted to heaven, shalt go down
to the underworld<sup><a href="#r401123b" id="f401123b" title=

that were done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have
remained until this day. <sup>24</sup>But I say to you, that it
will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of
judgment, than for thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>At that time Jesus answered and said: I
thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst
hide these things from the wise and discerning, and reveal them to
babes; <sup>26</sup>yea, O Father, that so it seemed good in thy
sight! <sup>27</sup>All things were delivered to me by my Father;
and no one knows the Son but the Father; nor does any one know the
Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Come unto me all ye that labor and are
heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. <sup>29</sup>Take my yoke
upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and
ye shall find rest for your souls. <sup>30</sup>For my yoke is
easy, and my burden light.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">t</span> that time
Jesus went on the sabbath through the grain-fields; and his
disciples were hungry, and began to pluck ears of grain, and to
eat. <sup>2</sup>And the Pharisees seeing it said to him: Behold,
thy disciples are doing that which it is not lawful to do on the
sabbath. <sup>3</sup>And he said to them: Have ye not read what
David did, when he hungered, himself and those with him;
<sup>4</sup>how he entered into the house of God, and ate the
show-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those
with him, but for the priests alone? <sup>5</sup>Or have ye not
read in the law, that on the sabbath the priests in the temple
profane the sabbath, and are blameless? <sup>6</sup>But I say to
you, that a greater than the temple is here. <sup>7</sup>But if ye
had known what this means, <span class="ot">I desire mercy and not
sacrifice</span>, ye would not have condemned the blameless.
<sup>8</sup>For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And departing from thence, he went into
their synagogue. <sup>10</sup>And behold, there was a man, having
his hand withered. And they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal
on the sabbath? that they might accuse him. <sup>11</sup>And he
said to them: What man will there be of you, that shall have one
sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay
hold of it, and raise it up? <sup>12</sup>How much better then is a
man than a sheep! So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbath.
<sup>13</sup>Then he says to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And
he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And the Pharisees went out, and took
counsel against him, how they might destroy him. <sup>15</sup>But
Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from thence; and great multitudes
followed him, and he healed them all. <sup>16</sup>And he charged
them that they should not make him known; <sup>17</sup>that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet,
saying:</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>18</sup>Behold my servant, whom I chose,</p>
<p class="pp2">My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased.</p>
<p class="pp2">I will put my spirit upon him,</p>
<p class="pp2">And he will declare judgment to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>19</sup>He will not strive, nor cry;</p>
<p class="pp2">Nor will any one hear his voice in the streets.</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>20</sup>A bruised reed he will not break,</p>
<p class="pp2">And smoking flax he will not quench,</p>
<p class="pp2">Till he send forth judgment unto victory.</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>21</sup>And in his name will Gentiles hope.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>Then was brought to him one possessed
with a demon, blind, and dumb; and he healed him, so that the blind
and dumb both<sup><a href="#r401222" id="f401222" title=
"see footnote" name="f401222">22</a></sup> spoke and saw.
<sup>23</sup>And all the multitudes were amazed, and said: Is this
the Son of David? <sup>24</sup>But the Pharisees hearing it said:
This man does not cast out the demons, except through Beelzebul,
prince of the demons. <sup>25</sup>And Jesus, knowing their
thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is
brought to desolation; and any city or house divided against itself
shall not stand. <sup>26</sup>And if Satan cast out Satan, he is
divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
<sup>27</sup>And if I through Beelzebul cast out the demons,
through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be
your judges. <sup>28</sup>But if I through the Spirit of God cast
out the demons, then is the kingdom of God come near to you.
<sup>29</sup>Or how can any one enter into a strong man's house,
and seize upon his goods, except he first bind the strong man? And
then he will plunder his house.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>He that is not with me is against me;
and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>Therefore I say to you, every sin and
blasphemy will be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the
Spirit will not be forgiven. <sup>32</sup>And whoever speaks a word
against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks
against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in
this world, nor in that which is to come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Either make the tree good and its fruit
good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for from the
fruit the tree is known.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>Brood of vipers! How can ye, being
evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth speaks. <sup>35</sup>The good man out of the good treasure
sends forth good things; and the evil man out of the evil treasure
sends forth evil things. <sup>36</sup>But I say to you, that every
idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in
the day of judgment. <sup>37</sup>For from thy words thou shalt be
justified, and from thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>Then certain of the scribes and of the
Pharisees answered him saying: Teacher, we desire to see a sign
from thee. <sup>39</sup>But he answering said to them: An evil and
adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be
given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet. <sup>40</sup>For as
Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, so
shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of
the earth. <sup>41</sup>Men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment
with this generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at
the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
<sup>42</sup>A queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with
this generation, and will condemn it; for she came from the utmost
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a
greater than Solomon is here.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>But when the unclean spirit is gone out
from the man, he goes through dry places seeking rest, and finds it
not. <sup>44</sup>Then he says, I will return into my house from
whence I came out and coming he finds it empty, swept, and set in
order. <sup>45</sup>Then he goes, and takes with him seven other
spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell
there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.
So shall it be also with this wicked generation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>While he was yet speaking to the
multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers were standing
without, seeking to speak to him. <sup>47</sup>And one said to him:
Behold, thy mother and thy brothers are standing without, seeking
to speak to thee. <sup>48</sup>But he answering said to him that
told him: Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?
<sup>49</sup>And stretching forth his hand toward his disciples, he
said: Behold my mother and my brothers! <sup>50</sup>For whoever
shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother,
and sister, and mother.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> on that
day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea-side.
<sup>2</sup>And great multitudes were gathered together to him, so
that he went into the ship and sat down; and all the multitude
stood on the beach. <sup>3</sup>And he spoke many things to them in
parables, saying:</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Behold, the sower went forth to sow. And
as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and the birds came and
devoured them. <sup>5</sup>And others fell on the rocky places,
where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprang up,
because they had not depth of earth. <sup>6</sup>And when the sun
was up, they were scorched; and because they had not root, they
withered away. <sup>7</sup>And others fell upon the thorns; and the
thorns came up, and choked them. <sup>8</sup>And others fell on the
good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty,
some thirty. <sup>9</sup>He that has ears to hear, let him
hear<sup><a href="#r401309" id="f401309" title="see footnote" name=
"f401309">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And the disciples came and said to him:
Why dost thou speak to them in parables? <sup>11</sup>And he
answering said to them: To you it is given<sup><a href="#r401311"
id="f401311" title="see footnote" name="f401311">11</a></sup> to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not
given. <sup>12</sup>For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he
shall have abundance; but whoever has not, even what he has shall
be taken from him. <sup>13</sup>Therefore I speak to them in
parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not,
nor understand. <sup>14</sup>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy
of Isaiah, which says:</p>
<p class="pp1">With the hearing ye will hear, and will not
understand;</p>
<p class="pp1">And seeing ye will see, and will not perceive.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>15</sup>For the heart of this people is become
gross,</p>
<p class="pp1">And their ears are dull of hearing,</p>
<p class="pp1">And their eyes they have closed;</p>
<p class="pp1">Lest haply they see with their eyes,</p>
<p class="pp1">And hear with their ears,</p>
<p class="pp1">And understand with their heart,</p>
<p class="pp1">And turn, and I shall heal them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>But happy are your eyes, because they
see; and your ears, because they hear. <sup>17</sup>For verily I
say to you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see
what ye are beholding, and did not see, and to hear what ye are
hearing, and did not hear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Hear therefore the parable of the
sower. <sup>19</sup>When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and
understands not, then comes the evil one and snatches away what was
sown in his heart. This is that which was sown by the way-side.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And that sown on the rocky places, this
is he that hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;
<sup>21</sup>and has not root in himself, but is only for a time;
and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word,
immediately he is offended.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And that sown among the thorns, this is
he that hears the word, and the care of this world and the
deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
<sup>23</sup>And that sown on the good ground, this is he that
hears the word and understands; who bears fruit, and produces, some
a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Another parable he put forth to them,
saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good
seed in his field. <sup>25</sup>But while men slept, his enemy came
and sowed darnel among the wheat, and went away. <sup>26</sup>And
when the blade sprang up and produced fruit, then appeared the
darnel also. <sup>27</sup>And the servants of the householder came
and said to him: Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field?
From whence then has it darnel? <sup>28</sup>He said to them: An
enemy did this. The servants said to him: Wilt thou then that we go
and gather them up? <sup>29</sup>He said: Nay, lest while ye gather
up the darnel, ye root up the wheat with them. <sup>30</sup>Let
both grow together until the harvest. And in time of harvest I will
say to the reapers: Gather up first the darnel, and bind them in
bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>Another parable he put forth to them,
saying: The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard, which
a man took and sowed in his field. <sup>32</sup>Which is the least
indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the
herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and
lodge in its branches.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Another parable he spoke to them: The
kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in
three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>All these things Jesus spoke to the
multitudes in parables; and without a parable he spoke nothing to
them; <sup>35</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
through the prophet, saying:</p>
<p class="pp1">I will open my mouth in parables;</p>
<p class="pp1">I will utter things hidden from the foundation of
the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>Then having sent away the
multitudes<sup><a href="#r401336" id="f401336" title="see footnote"
name="f401336">36</a></sup>, he went into the house. And his
disciples came to him, saying: Explain to us the parable of the
darnel of the field. <sup>37</sup>And answering he said to
them:</p>
<p class="pin">He that sows the good seed is the Son of man.
<sup>38</sup>The field is the world. The good seed, these are the
sons of the kingdom; but the darnel are the sons of the evil one,
<sup>39</sup>and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil. The
harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.
<sup>40</sup>As therefore the darnel are gathered up and are burned
with fire, so shall it be in the end of the world. <sup>41</sup>The
Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of
his kingdom all the causes of offense, and those who do iniquity,
<sup>42</sup>and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there
will be the wailing, and the gnashing of teeth! <sup>43</sup>Then
will the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
Father. He that has ears to hear, let him hear<sup><a href=
"#r401343" id="f401343" title="see footnote" name=
"f401343">43</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to
a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and concealed;
and for joy thereof<sup><a href="#r401344" id="f401344" title=
"see footnote" name="f401344">44</a></sup>, he goes and sells all
that he has, and buys that field.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to
a merchant seeking goodly pearls; <sup>46</sup>and having found one
pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought
it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to
a net, cast into the sea, and gathering together of every kind.
<sup>48</sup>Which, when it was filled, they drew up upon the
beach, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but cast
the bad away. <sup>49</sup>So will it be in the end of the world.
The angels will go forth, and will separate the wicked from among
the just, <sup>50</sup>and will cast them into the furnace of fire;
there will be the wailing, and the gnashing of teeth!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>51</sup>Did ye understand all these things?
They say to him, Yea, Lord. <sup>52</sup>And he said to them:
Therefore every scribe, instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is
like to a householder, who brings forth out of his treasure new and
old.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>53</sup>And it came to pass, when Jesus
finished these parables, that he departed thence. <sup>54</sup>And
coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue; so
that they were astonished, and said: Whence has this man this
wisdom, and the miracles? Is not this the carpenter's son?
<sup>55</sup>Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers,
James, and Joseph<sup><a href="#r401355" id="f401355" title=

<sup>56</sup>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then
has this man all these things? <sup>57</sup>And they were offended
at him. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor,
save in his own country, and in his own house.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>58</sup>And he did not many miracles there,
because of their unbelief.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus. <sup>2</sup>And he said
to his servants: This is John the Immerser; he is risen from the
dead, and therefore do these powers<sup><a href="#r401402" id=
"f401402" title="see footnote" name="f401402">2</a></sup> work in
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>For Herod laid hold of John, and bound
him and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodias, the wife of
Philip, his brother. <sup>4</sup>For John said to him: It is not
lawful for thee to have her. <sup>5</sup>And though desiring to put
him to death, he feared the multitude, because they held him as a
prophet. <sup>6</sup>But when Herod's birthday was kept, the
daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
<sup>7</sup>Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her
whatever she should ask. <sup>8</sup>And she, being urged on by her
mother, says: Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the
Immerser. <sup>9</sup>And the king was sorry; but for the sake of
the oath, and of those who reclined at table with him, he commanded
it to be given. <sup>10</sup>And he sent, and beheaded John in the
prison. <sup>11</sup>And his head was brought on a platter, and was
given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.
<sup>12</sup>And his disciples came and took up the body, and
buried it; and they went and reported it to Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And when Jesus heard it, he withdrew
from thence by ship, into a desert place apart. And the multitudes
hearing of it, followed him on foot from the cities.
<sup>14</sup>And going forth he saw a great multitude, and had
compassion on them, and he healed their sick.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And when it was evening, his disciples
came to him, saying: The place is desert, and the time is already
passed away; dismiss the multitudes, that they may go away into the
villages, and buy themselves victuals. <sup>16</sup>But Jesus said
to them: They need not go away; give ye them to eat.
<sup>17</sup>And they say to him: We have here but five loaves, and
two fishes. <sup>18</sup>He said: Bring them hither to me.
<sup>19</sup>And he commanded that the multitudes should lie down
on the grass, and took the five loaves and the two fishes, and
looking up to heaven he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to
the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
<sup>20</sup>And they all ate, and were filled; and they took up of
the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. <sup>21</sup>And
they who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and
children.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And straightway he constrained his
disciples to enter into the ship, and to go before him to the other
side, while he dismissed the multitudes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And having dismissed the multitudes, he
went up into the mountain apart to pray; and when evening was come,
he was there alone. <sup>24</sup>But the ship was already in the
midst of the sea, vexed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
<sup>25</sup>And in the fourth watch of the night he went to them,
walking on the sea. <sup>26</sup>And the disciples, seeing him
walking on the sea, were troubled, saying: It is a spectre. And
they cried out for fear. <sup>27</sup>But straightway Jesus spoke
to them, saying: Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid.
<sup>28</sup>And Peter answering him said: Lord, if it is thou, bid
me come to thee on the water. <sup>29</sup>And he said: Come. And
coming down from the ship, Peter walked on the water, to go to
Jesus. <sup>30</sup>But seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid;
and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.
<sup>31</sup>And immediately Jesus, stretching forth his hand, took
hold of him, and said to him: Thou of little faith, wherefore didst
thou doubt?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And when they had entered into the
ship, the wind ceased. <sup>33</sup>And those in the ship came and
worshiped him<sup><a href="#r401433" id="f401433" title=

thou art the Son of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>And passing over, they came into the
land of Gennesaret. <sup>35</sup>And the men of that place, knowing
him, sent out into all that country round, and brought to him all
that were diseased <sup>36</sup>and besought him that they might
only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched were
made whole.</p>

enters into the mouth defiles the man; but that which comes out of
the mouth, this defiles the man.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Then came to him his disciples, and
said to him: Knowest thou that the Pharisees, when they heard the
saying, were offended? <sup>13</sup>And he answering said: Every
plant, which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.
<sup>14</sup>Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind;
and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And Peter answering said to him:
Explain to us this parable. <sup>16</sup>And he said: Are ye also
even yet without understanding? <sup>17</sup>Do ye not yet
understand, that whatever enters into the mouth goes into the
belly, and is cast out into the drain? <sup>18</sup>But the things
that proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they
defile the man. <sup>19</sup>For out of the heart proceed evil
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts,
false-witnessings, blasphemies. <sup>20</sup>These are the things
that defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defiles not the
man.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And Jesus, going forth from thence,
withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. <sup>22</sup>And
behold, a woman of Canaan, coming out from those borders, cried to
him, saying: Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is
grievously possessed with a demon. <sup>23</sup>But he answered her
not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying:
Dismiss her; because she cries after us. <sup>24</sup>But he
answering said: I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel. <sup>25</sup>But she came and bowed down to him,
saying: Lord, help me. <sup>26</sup>But he answering said: It is
not good to take the children's bread, and cast it to the dogs.
<sup>27</sup>And she said: Yea, Lord; for the dogs also eat of the
crumbs that fall from their masters' table. <sup>28</sup>Then Jesus
answering said to her: O woman, great is thy faith; be it done to
thee as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And departing from thence, Jesus came
near to the sea of Galilee; and going up into the mountain, he sat
down there. <sup>30</sup>And great multitudes came to him, having
with them lame, blind dumb, maimed, and many others, and laid them
down at his feet, and he healed them; <sup>31</sup>so that the
multitudes wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed
whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified
the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And Jesus, having called to him his
disciples, said: I have compassion on the multitude, because they
continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; and I
will not dismiss them fasting, lest they faint in the way.
<sup>33</sup>And his disciples say to him: Whence should we have so
many loaves in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
<sup>34</sup>And Jesus says to them: How many loaves have ye? And
they said: Seven, and a few little fishes. <sup>35</sup>And he
commanded the multitudes to lie down on the ground.
<sup>36</sup>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave
thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to
the multitude. <sup>37</sup>And they all ate, and were filled. And
they took up of the fragments that remained seven baskets full.
<sup>38</sup>And they who ate were four thousand men, besides women
and children. <sup>39</sup>And dismissing the multitudes, he
entered into the ship, and came into the borders of Magdala.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> the
Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, and tempting desired him to
show them a sign from heaven. <sup>2</sup>And he answering said to
them: When it is evening, ye say: Fair weather! for the sky is red.
<sup>3</sup>And in the morning: A storm to-day! for the sky is red
and lowering. Ye know how to discern the face of the sky, but can
ye not the signs of the times?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>An evil and adulterous generation seeks
after a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of
Jonah. And he left them, and departed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And coming to the other side, his
disciples forgot to take bread. <sup>6</sup>And Jesus said to them:
Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
<sup>7</sup>And they reasoned among themselves, saying: Because we
took no bread! <sup>8</sup>And Jesus knowing it said: Ye of little
faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye took no bread?
<sup>9</sup>Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves
of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
<sup>10</sup>Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how
many baskets ye took up? <sup>11</sup>How is it that ye do not
understand, that I spoke not to you of bread? But, beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees! <sup>12</sup>Then they
understood, that he did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread,
but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And having come into the region of
C&aelig;sarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples, saying: Who do
men say that the Son of man is<sup><a href="#r401613" id="f401613"
title="see footnote" name="f401613">13</a></sup>? <sup>14</sup>And
they said: Some, John the Immerser; and others, Elijah; and others,
Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>He says to them: But who do ye say that
I am? <sup>16</sup>And Simon Peter answering said: Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God. <sup>17</sup>And Jesus answering
said to him: Happy art thou, Simon Bar-jonah<sup><a href="#r401617"
id="f401617" title="see footnote" name="f401617">17</a></sup>; for
flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee, but my Father who is in
heaven. <sup>18</sup>And I also say to thee, that thou art
Peter<sup><a href="#r401618a" id="f401618a" title="see footnote"
name="f401618a">18a</a></sup>, and upon this rock I will build my
church<sup><a href="#r401618b" id="f401618b" title="see footnote"
name="f401618b">18b</a></sup>; and the gates of the underworld
shall not prevail against it. <sup>19</sup>And I will give to thee
the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever thou shalt loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Then he charged his disciples, that
they should tell no one that he is the Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>From that time Jesus began to show to
his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things
from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death,
and rise on the third day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And Peter taking him aside began to
rebuke him, saying: Be it far from thee, Lord; this shall not be to
thee. <sup>23</sup>But he turned and said to Peter: Get thee behind
me, Satan<sup><a href="#r401623" id="f401623" title="see footnote"
name="f401623">23</a></sup>; thou art an offense to me; for thou
thinkest not the things of God, but those of men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Then Jesus said to his disciples: If
any one will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me. <sup>25</sup>For whoever will save his life
shall lose it; and whoever may lose his life for my sake, shall
find it. <sup>26</sup>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain
the whole world, and forfeit his soul? Or what shall a man give as
an exchange<sup><a href="#r401626" id="f401626" title=
"see footnote" name="f401626">26</a></sup> for his soul?
<sup>27</sup>For the Son of man will come in the glory of his
Father, with his angels; and then he will reward each one according
to his works.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Verily I say to you, there are some of
those standing here, who shall not taste death, till they see the
Son of man coming in his kingdom.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> after six
days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John his brother,
and brings them up into a high mountain apart. <sup>2</sup>And he
was transfigured before them; and his face shone as the sun, and
his garments became white as the light. <sup>3</sup>And behold,
there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.
<sup>4</sup>And Peter answering said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for
us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tents; one for
thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. <sup>5</sup>While he
was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And
behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. <sup>6</sup>And the
disciples, hearing it, fell on their face, and were exceedingly
afraid. <sup>7</sup>And Jesus coming to them touched them, and
said: Arise, and be not afraid. <sup>8</sup>And lifting up their
eyes, they saw no one save Jesus only.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And as they came down out of the
mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell no one the vision, until
the Son of man is risen from the dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And his disciples asked him, saying:
Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
<sup>11</sup>And he answering said: Elijah indeed comes, and will
restore all things. <sup>12</sup>But I say to you, that Elijah is
already come, and they knew him not, but did with him whatever they
would. So also is the Son of man about to suffer by them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Then the disciples understood that he
spoke to them of John the Immerser.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And when they were come to the
multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him, and
saying: <sup>15</sup>Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is lunatic,
and is sorely afflicted; for ofttimes he falls into the fire, and
oft into the water. <sup>16</sup>And I brought him to thy
disciples, and they could not cure him. <sup>17</sup>And Jesus
answering said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall
I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to
me. <sup>18</sup>And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out from
him, and the child was cured from that hour.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Then the disciples, coming to Jesus
apart, said: Why could not we cast him out? <sup>20</sup>And he
said to them: Because of your want of faith. For verily I say to
you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this
mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove; and
nothing shall be impossible to you. <sup>21</sup>But this kind goes
not forth, except by prayer and fasting.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus
said to them: The Son of man is about to be delivered into the
hands of men <sup>23</sup>and they will put him to death, and he
will rise on the third day. And they were exceedingly
sorrowful.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And they having come to Capernaum,
those who received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said: Does
not your teacher pay the half-shekel<sup><a href="#r401724" id=
"f401724" title="see footnote" name="f401724">24</a></sup>?
<sup>25</sup>He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus
anticipated him, saying: What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the
kings of the earth take customs, or tribute? Of their sons, or of
strangers? <sup>26</sup>He says to him: Of strangers. Jesus said to
him: Then are the sons free. <sup>27</sup>But that we may not
offend them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the fish that
first comes up; and opening its mouth thou wilt find a shekel; that
take, and give to them for me and thee.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">t</span> that time
came the disciples to Jesus, saying: Who then is greatest in the
kingdom of heaven?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And Jesus, calling a little child to
him, placed it in the midst of them, <sup>3</sup>and said: Verily I
say to you, if ye do not turn and become as the little children, ye
shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. <sup>4</sup>Whoever
therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven. <sup>5</sup>And whoever shall
receive one such little child, in my name, receives me.
<sup>6</sup>But whoever shall cause one of these little ones that
believe on me to offend, it were better for him that an upper
millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were plunged in the
depth of the sea.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Woe to the world, for causes of offense!
For it must needs be that causes of offense come; but woe to that
man, through whom the cause of offense comes! <sup>8</sup>But if
thy hand or thy foot causes thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it
from thee. It is better for thee to enter into life lame or maimed,
than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the everlasting
fire. <sup>9</sup>And if thine eye causes thee to offend, pluck it
out and cast it from thee. It is better for thee to enter into life
with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Take heed that ye despise not one of
these little ones; for I say to you, that their angels in heaven
always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
<sup>11</sup>For the Son of man came to save that which was
lost.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>What think ye? If a man has a hundred
sheep, and one of them is gone astray, does he not leave the ninety
and nine upon the mountains, and go and seek that which is gone
astray? <sup>13</sup>And if it be that he find it, verily I say to
you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine that
went not astray. <sup>14</sup>So it is not the will of your Father
who is in heaven, that one of these little ones perish.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>But if thy brother shall sin against
thee, go show him his fault between thee and him alone, If he shall
hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. <sup>16</sup>But if he
hear not, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two
or three witnesses every word may be established. <sup>17</sup>And
if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he
neglect to hear the church also, let him be to thee as a heathen
and a publican. <sup>18</sup>Verily I say to you: Whatever ye shall
bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever ye shall loose
on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Again I say to you, that if two of you
shall agree on earth, concerning any thing that they shall ask, it
shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
<sup>20</sup>For where two or three are gathered together in my
name, there am I in the midst of them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Then Peter came to him, and said: Lord,
how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until
seven times? <sup>22</sup>Jesus says to him: I say not to thee,
until seven times, but until seventy times seven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven
likened to a certain king, who desired to make a reckoning with his
servants. <sup>24</sup>And when he had begun to reckon, there was
brought to him one, who owed ten thousand talents<sup><a href=
"#r401824" id="f401824" title="see footnote" name=
"f401824">24</a></sup>. <sup>25</sup>But as he was not able to pay,
his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and
all that he had, and payment to be made. <sup>26</sup>The servant
therefore, falling, prostrated himself before him, saying: Have
patience with me, and I will pay thee all. <sup>27</sup>And the
lord of that servant, moved with compassion, released him, and
forgave him the debt. <sup>28</sup>But that servant went out, and
found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred
den&aacute;ries<sup><a href="#r401828" id="f401828" title=
"see footnote" name="f401828">28</a></sup>; and laying hold of him
he took him by the throat, saying: Pay me that thou owest.
<sup>29</sup>Therefore his fellow-servant fell down and besought
him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.
<sup>30</sup>And he would not; but went and cast him into prison,
till he should pay the debt. <sup>31</sup>And his fellow-servants,
seeing what was done, were very sorry, and came and disclosed to
their lord all that was done. <sup>32</sup>Then having called him,
his lord says to him: Thou wicked servant; I forgave thee all that
debt, because thou besoughtest me. <sup>33</sup>Shouldest not thou
also have had pity on thy fellow-servant, as I too had pity on
thee? <sup>34</sup>And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the
tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.
<sup>35</sup>So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye from
your hearts forgive not every one his brother.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> it came to
pass, when Jesus finished these sayings, that he departed from
Galilee, and came into the borders of Jud&aelig;a beyond the
Jordan. <sup>2</sup>And great multitudes followed him, and he
healed them there.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And the Pharisees came to him, tempting
him and saying: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for
every cause?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And he answering said to them: Have ye
not read, that he who made them<sup><a href="#r401904" id="f401904"
title="see footnote" name="f401904">4</a></sup> from the beginning
made them male and female, <sup>5</sup>and said: <span class=
"ot">For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall
cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.</span>
<sup>6</sup>So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What
therefore God joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>They say to him: Why then did Moses
command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
<sup>8</sup>He says to them: Moses, for your hardness of heart,
suffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was
not so. <sup>9</sup>And I say to you, that whoever shall put away
his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, commits
adultery; and whoever marries her when put away, commits
adultery.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>His disciples say to him: If the case
of the man with the woman is so, it is not good to marry.
<sup>11</sup>But he said to them: Not all can receive this saying,
but they to whom it is given. <sup>12</sup>For there are eunuchs,
who were so born from the mother's womb; and there are eunuchs, who
were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who made
themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that
is able to receive it, let him receive it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Then were brought to him little
children, that he might put his hands on them and pray; and the
disciples rebuked them. <sup>14</sup>But Jesus said: Suffer the
little children, and forbid them not to come to me; for to such
belongs the kingdom of heaven. <sup>15</sup>And he laid his hands
on them, and departed thence.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And, behold, one came to him and said:
Teacher, what good shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
<sup>17</sup>And, he said to him: Why dost thou ask me concerning
good? One is the Good. But if thou desirest to enter into life,
keep the commandments. <sup>18</sup>He says to him, Which? Jesus
said: <span class="ot">Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit
adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false
witness;</span> <sup>19</sup><span class="ot">Honor thy father and
thy mother;</span> and, <span class="ot">Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.</span> <sup>20</sup>The young man says to him:
All these I kept; what do I yet lack? <sup>21</sup>Jesus said to
him: If thou desirest to be perfect, go, sell what thou hast, and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come,
follow me. <sup>22</sup>But when the young man heard this saying,
he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And Jesus said to his disciples: Verily
I say to you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom
of heaven. <sup>24</sup>And again I say to you: It is easier for a
camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to
enter into the kingdom of God. <sup>25</sup>And the disciples,
hearing it, were exceedingly amazed, saying: Who then can be saved?
<sup>26</sup>But Jesus, looking on them, said to them: With men
this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
<sup>27</sup>Then Peter answering said to him: Behold, we forsook
all, and followed thee; what then shall we have? <sup>28</sup>And
Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, that ye who followed me,
in the renovation, when the Son of man shall sit on his throne of
glory, shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel. <sup>29</sup>And every one who forsook houses, or
brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,
or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive manifold more, and
shall inherit everlasting life. <sup>30</sup>But many first will be
last, and last first.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class="sc">or</span> the kingdom
of heaven is like to a householder, who went out early in the
morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. <sup>2</sup>And having
agreed with the laborers for a den&aacute;ry<sup><a href="#r402002"
id="f402002" title="see footnote" name="f402002">2</a></sup> a day,
he sent them into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And he went out about the third hour,
and saw others standing idle in the market-place. <sup>4</sup>And
to them he said: Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is
right I will give you. And they went their way.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Again he went out about the sixth and
ninth hour, and did likewise.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And about the eleventh he went out, and
found others standing, and says to them: Why stand ye here all the
day idle? <sup>7</sup>They say to him: Because no one hired us. He
says to them: Go ye also into the vineyard.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And when evening was come, the lord of
the vineyard says to his steward: Call the laborers, and pay them
the hire, beginning from the last, unto the first. <sup>9</sup>And
they of the eleventh hour came, and received every man a
den&aacute;ry. <sup>10</sup>But when the first came, they supposed
that they should receive more; and they also received each one a
den&aacute;ry. <sup>11</sup>And on receiving it, they murmured
against the householder, <sup>12</sup>saying: These last labored
one hour, and thou madest them equal to us, who bore the burden of
the day, and the burning heat.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>But he answering said to one of them:
Friend, I do thee no wrong. Didst thou not agree with me for a
den&aacute;ry? <sup>14</sup>Take what is thine, and go. But I will
give to this last, even as to thee. <sup>15</sup>Is it not lawful
for me to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I
am good?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>So will the last be first, and the
first last; for many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took
the twelve disciples apart; and in the way he said to them:
<sup>18</sup>Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of
man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they
will condemn him to death, <sup>19</sup>and will deliver him to the
Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify; and on the third day he
will rise again.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Then came to him the mother of the sons
of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing down and asking a certain thing
of him. <sup>21</sup>And he said to her: What wilt thou? She says
to him: Command that these my two sons shall sit, one on thy right
hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom. <sup>22</sup>But Jesus
answering said: Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of
the cup that I shall drink of? They say to him: We are able.
<sup>23</sup>And he says to them: Ye shall drink indeed of my cup;
but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give,
but is for them for whom it has been prepared by my Father.
<sup>24</sup>And the ten, hearing it, were much displeased with the
two brothers. <sup>25</sup>But Jesus, having called them to him,
said: Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise lordship
over them, and they that are great exercise authority over them.
<sup>26</sup>Not so shall it be among you; <sup>27</sup>but whoever
would become great among you, let him be your minister; and whoever
would be first among you, let him be your servant;
<sup>28</sup>even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to,
but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And as they were going forth from
Jericho, a great multitude followed him. <sup>30</sup>And behold,
two blind men sitting by the way-side, hearing that Jesus was
passing by, cried, saying: Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David.
<sup>31</sup>And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold
their peace. But they cried the more, saying: Have mercy on us, O
Lord, Son of David. <sup>32</sup>And Jesus stood still, and called
them, and said: What will ye that I shall do to you?
<sup>33</sup>They say to him: Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
<sup>34</sup>And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes;
and immediately their eyes received sight; and they followed
him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> when they
drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the mount of the
Olives, Jesus sent forth two disciples, <sup>2</sup>saying to them:
Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye will find
an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose and bring them to me.
<sup>3</sup>And if any one say aught to you, ye shall say: The Lord
has need of them; and straightway he will send them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Now all this has been done, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet,
saying:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>5</sup>Say to the daughter of Zion,</p>
<p class="pp1">Behold, thy King comes to thee,</p>
<p class="pp1">Meek, and mounted upon an ass,</p>
<p class="pp1">And upon a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And the disciples, having gone and done
as Jesus commanded them, <sup>7</sup>brought the ass and the colt,
and put on them their garments, and he sat thereon. <sup>8</sup>And
most of the multitude spread their own garments in the way; and
others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed in the way.
<sup>9</sup>And the multitudes that went before, and that followed,
cried, saying: Hosanna<sup><a href="#r402109" id="f402109" title=
"see footnote" name="f402109">9</a></sup> to the Son of David;
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the
highest. <sup>10</sup>And as he entered into Jerusalem, all the
city was moved, saying: Who is this? <sup>11</sup>And the
multitudes said: This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of
Galilee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And Jesus entered into the temple of
God, and cast out all that sold and bought in the temple, and
overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those
who sold doves. <sup>13</sup>And he says to them: It is
written,</p>
<p class="pp2">My house shall be called a house of prayer;</p>
<p class="pp2">But ye make it a den of robbers.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And the blind and the lame came to him
in the temple, and he healed them. <sup>15</sup>But the chief
priests and the scribes, seeing the wonders that he did, and the
children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of
David, were much displeased, <sup>16</sup>and said to him: Dost
thou hear what these say? And Jesus says to them: Yea; did ye never
read: <span class="ot">From the mouth of babes and sucklings thou
preparedst praise?</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And leaving them, he went forth out of
the city into Bethany, and lodged there.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And in the morning, as he was returning
into the city, he hungered. <sup>19</sup>And seeing a fig-tree by
the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only.
And he says to it: Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward,
forever. And immediately the fig-tree withered away.
<sup>20</sup>And the disciples seeing it wondered, saying: How did
the fig-tree immediately wither away? <sup>21</sup>And Jesus
answering said to them: Verily I say to you, if ye have faith, and
do not doubt, not only shall ye do what is done to the fig-tree,
but even if ye say to this mountain, be thou taken up and cast into
the sea, it shall be done. <sup>22</sup>And all things whatever ye
ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And when he had come into the temple,
the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he
was teaching, and said: By what authority doest thou these things;
and who gave thee this authority? <sup>24</sup>And Jesus answering
said to them: I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I
too will tell you by what authority I do these things.
<sup>25</sup>John's immersion, whence was it? From heaven, or from
men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying: If we say, From
heaven, he will say to us: Why then did ye not believe him?
<sup>26</sup>But if we say, From men, we fear the multitude; for
all hold John as a prophet. <sup>27</sup>And they answered Jesus,
saying: We do not know. And he said to them: Neither do I say to
you, by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>But what think ye? A man had two sons;
and he came to the first, and said: Son, go work to-day in the
vineyard. <sup>29</sup>And he answering said: I will not; but
afterward he repented, and went. <sup>30</sup>And he came to the
other<sup><a href="#r402130" id="f402130" title="see footnote"
name="f402130">30</a></sup>, and said likewise. And he answering
said: I will, sir; and went not. <sup>31</sup>Which of the two did
the father's will? They say to him: The first<sup><a href=
"#r402131" id="f402131" title="see footnote" name=
"f402131">31</a></sup>. Jesus says to them: Verily I say to you,
that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God
before you. <sup>32</sup>For John came to you in the way of
righteousness, and ye did not believe him; but the publicans and
the harlots believed him; and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not
afterward, that ye might believe him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Hear another parable. There was a
householder, who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and
dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to
husband-men, and went abroad. <sup>34</sup>And when the season of
fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to
receive his fruits. <sup>35</sup>And the husbandmen taking his
servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
<sup>36</sup>Again he sent other servants, more than the first; and
they did to them likewise. <sup>37</sup>And afterward he sent to
them his son, saying: They will reverence my son. <sup>38</sup>But
the husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the
heir; come, let us kill him, and have his inheritance.
<sup>39</sup>And taking him, they cast him out of the vineyard, and
killed him. <sup>40</sup>When therefore the lord of the vineyard
comes, what will he do to those husbandmen? <sup>41</sup>They say
to him: He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let
out the vineyard to other husbandmen, who will deliver over to him
the fruits in their seasons. <sup>42</sup>Jesus says to them: Did
ye never read in the Scriptures:</p>
<p class="pp2">The stone which the builders disallowed,</p>
<p class="pp2">The same is become the head of the corner;</p>
<p class="pp2">This is from the Lord,</p>
<p class="pp2">And is wonderful in our eyes.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>43</sup>Therefore I say to you, that the
kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof. <sup>44</sup>And he that falls
upon this stone will be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it
will grind him to powder.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>And the chief priests and Pharisees,
hearing his parables, knew that he spoke of them. <sup>46</sup>And
they sought to lay hold of him, but feared the multitudes, since
they held him as a prophet.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> Jesus
answering spoke to them again in parables, saying:</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>The kingdom of heaven is like to a
certain king, who made a marriage for his son. <sup>3</sup>And he
sent forth his servants to call those who were bidden to the
wedding; and they would not come. <sup>4</sup>Again he sent forth
other servants, saying: Tell those who are bidden, Behold, I have
prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all
things are ready; come to the marriage. <sup>5</sup>But they made
light of it, and went away, one to his farm, another to his
merchandise. <sup>6</sup>And the rest laid hold of his servants,
and ill-treated and slew them. <sup>7</sup>And the king, hearing
it, was angry; and sending forth his armies, he destroyed those
murderers, and burned up their city. <sup>8</sup>Then he says to
his servants: The wedding is ready, but they who were bidden were
not worthy. <sup>9</sup>Go therefore into the thoroughfares, and as
many as ye find, bid to the marriage. <sup>10</sup>And those
servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as
many as they found, both bad and good; and the wedding was
furnished with guests.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And the king, coming in to view the
guests, saw there a man not clothed with a wedding garment;
<sup>12</sup>and he says to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither,
not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
<sup>13</sup>Then the king said to the attendants: Bind him hand
and foot, and cast him forth into the outer darkness. There will be
the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth! <sup>14</sup>For many are
called, but few are chosen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Then the Pharisees went and took
counsel, how they might ensnare him with a word<sup><a href=
"#r402215" id="f402215" title="see footnote" name=
"f402215">15</a></sup>. <sup>16</sup>And they send out to him their
disciples, with the Herodians, saying: Teacher, we know that thou
art true, and teachest the way of God in truth; neither carest thou
for any one, for thou regardest not the person of men.
<sup>17</sup>Tell us, therefore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawful
to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, or not? <sup>18</sup>But Jesus,
knowing their wickedness, said: Why tempt ye me, hypocrites!
<sup>19</sup>Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a
den&aacute;ry<sup><a href="#r402219" id="f402219" title=
"see footnote" name="f402219">19</a></sup>. <sup>20</sup>And he
says to them: Whose is this image, and the inscription?
<sup>21</sup>They say to him: C&aelig;sar's. Then says he to them;
Render therefore to C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's,
and to God the things that are God's. <sup>22</sup>And hearing it
they wondered, and left him and went away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>On that day came to him Sadducees, who
say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
<sup>24</sup>saying: Teacher, Moses said, <span class="ot">If any
one die having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and
raise up seed to his brother.</span> <sup>25</sup>Now there were
with us seven brothers; and the first married and died, and having
no seed left his wife to his brother. <sup>26</sup>Likewise the
second also, and the third, unto the seventh. <sup>27</sup>And last
of all the woman died also. <sup>28</sup>In the resurrection
therefore, of which of the seven shall she be wife? For they all
had her.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>Jesus answering said to them: Ye err,
not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. <sup>30</sup>For
in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,
but are as the angels of God in heaven. <sup>31</sup>But concerning
the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was
spoken to you by God, saying: <sup>32</sup><span class="ot">I am
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob?</span> God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
<sup>33</sup>And the multitudes, hearing it, were astonished at his
teaching.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>And the Pharisees, hearing that he had
put the Sadducees to silence, collected together; <sup>35</sup>and
one of them, a lawyer, asked, tempting him and saying:
<sup>36</sup>Teacher, what commandment is great in the law?
<sup>37</sup>Jesus said to him: <span class="ot">Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy mind.</span> <sup>38</sup>This is the great and first
commandment. <sup>39</sup>And the second is like to it:
<span class="ot">Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self.</span>
<sup>40</sup>On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>While the Pharisees were collected
together, Jesus asked them, <sup>42</sup>saying: What think ye
concerning the Christ? Of whom is he the son? They say to him: Of
David. <sup>43</sup>He says to them: How then does David, in the
Spirit, call him Lord, saying:</p>
<p class="pp3"><sup>44</sup>The Lord said to my Lord,</p>
<p class="pp3">Sit on my right hand,</p>
<p class="pp3">Till I put thine enemies under thy feet.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>45</sup>If then David calls him Lord, how is he
his son? <sup>46</sup>And no one was able to answer him a word; nor
durst any one from that day question him any more.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

spoke to the multitudes, and to his disciples, <sup>2</sup>saying:
The scribes and the Pharisees sat down in Moses' seat.
<sup>3</sup>All, therefore, whatever they bid you, do and observe;
but do not according to their works, for they say and do not.
<sup>4</sup>For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne,
and lay them on men's shoulders, but will not move them with their
finger. <sup>5</sup>But all their works they do to be seen by men;
they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the fringes;
<sup>6</sup>and love the first place at feasts, and the first seats
in the synagogues, <sup>7</sup>and the greetings in the markets,
and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi<sup><a href="#r402307" id=
"f402307" title="see footnote" name="f402307">7</a></sup>.
<sup>8</sup>But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your Teacher,
and all ye are brethren. <sup>9</sup>And call not any your father
on the earth; for one is your Father, he who is in heaven.
<sup>10</sup>Neither be called leaders; for one is your leader, the
Christ. <sup>11</sup>But the greatest of you shall be your servant.
<sup>12</sup>And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and
he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! because ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men;

in<sup><a href="#r402313" id="f402313" title="see footnote" name=

<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! because ye traverse sea and land to make one proselyte,
and when he is made, ye make him twofold more a child of hell than
yourselves.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Woe to you, blind guides, who say:
Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall
swear by the gold of the temple, he is bound. <sup>17</sup>Fools
and blind; for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that
sanctifies the gold? <sup>18</sup>And, Whoever shall swear by the
altar, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gift that is
upon it, he is bound. <sup>19</sup>Fools and blind; for which is
greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>He therefore who swears by the altar,
swears by it, and by all things thereon. <sup>21</sup>And he that
swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who dwells therein.
<sup>22</sup>And he that swears by heaven, swears by the throne of
God, and by him who sits thereon.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! because ye pay tithe of the mint and the dill and the
cumin, and omitted the weightier things of the law, judgment, and
mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not leave those
undone.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Blind guides! that strain out the gnat,
and swallow the camel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and the
platter, but within they are full of rapacity and excess.
<sup>26</sup>Blind Pharisee! Cleanse first the inside of the cup
and the platter, that its outside also may become clean.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! because ye are like to whited sepulchres, which
outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of bones of
the dead, and of all uncleanness. <sup>28</sup>So also ye outwardly
indeed appear righteous to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy
and iniquity.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say: <sup>30</sup>If we had
been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the prophets. <sup>31</sup>So that ye
witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of those who killed the
prophets; <sup>32</sup>and fill ye up the measure of your
fathers!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Serpents! Brood of vipers! How can ye
escape the judgment of hell?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>Therefore, behold, I send forth to you
prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye will kill
and crucify, and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues,
and persecute from city to city; <sup>35</sup>that on you may come
all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of
righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye
slew between the temple and the altar. <sup>36</sup>Verily I say to
you, all these things shall come upon this generation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that killest the
prophets, and stonest those sent to her; how often would I have
gathered thy children together, as a hen gathers her chickens under
her wings, and ye would not! <sup>38</sup>Behold, your house is
left to you desolate. <sup>39</sup>For I say to you, ye shall not
see me henceforth, till ye shall say: Blessed is he that comes in
the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

went out, and departed from the temple; and his disciples came to
him, to show him the buildings of the temple. <sup>2</sup>And he
answering said to them: See ye not all these things? Verily I say
to you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that
shall not be thrown down.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And as he sat on the mount of the
Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying: Tell us, when
will these things be, and what is the sign of thy coming and of the
end of the world? <sup>4</sup>And Jesus answering said to them:
Take heed, lest any one lead you astray. <sup>5</sup>For many will
come in my name, saying: I am the Christ; and will lead astray
many. <sup>6</sup>And ye will hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
Take heed, be not troubled; for all must come to pass<sup><a href=
"#r402406" id="f402406" title="see footnote" name=

nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and
there will be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers
places. <sup>8</sup>But all these are the beginning of sorrows.
<sup>9</sup>Then will they deliver you up unto affliction, and will
kill you; and ye will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
<sup>10</sup>And then will many be offended, and will deliver up
one another, and will hate one another. <sup>11</sup>And many false
prophets will arise, and will lead many astray. <sup>12</sup>And
because iniquity abounds, the love of the many will become cold.
<sup>13</sup>But he that has endured to the end, the same shall be
saved. <sup>14</sup>And this good news of the kingdom shall be
preached in all the world, for a testimony to all nations; and then
shall come the end.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>When therefore ye see the abomination
of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in
the holy place (let him that reads mark!) <sup>16</sup>then let
those in Jud&aelig;a flee to the mountains; he that is upon the
house, <sup>17</sup>let him not come down to take the things out of
his house; <sup>18</sup>and he that is in the field, let him not
turn back to take his garments. <sup>19</sup>But woe to those who
are with child, and to those who give suck in those days!
<sup>20</sup>And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor on a
sabbath. <sup>21</sup>For then will be great affliction, such as
has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no nor
shall be. <sup>22</sup>And unless those days were shortened, no
flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the chosen, those days
shall be shortened. <sup>23</sup>Then if any one say to you: Lo,
here is the Christ, or, Here, believe it not. <sup>24</sup>For
there will arise false Christs, and false prophets, and will show
great signs and wonders; so as, if possible, to lead even the
chosen astray. <sup>25</sup>Behold, I have told you before.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>If therefore they say to you: Behold,
he is in the desert, go not forth; Behold, he is in the secret
chambers, believe it not. <sup>27</sup>For as the lightning comes
forth from the east, and shines even unto the west, so shall be the
coming of the Son of man. <sup>28</sup>For wherever the carcass is,
there will the eagles be gathered together.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And immediately, after the affliction
of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not
give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the
powers of heaven shall be shaken. <sup>30</sup>And then shall
appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the
tribes of the earth<sup><a href="#r402430" id="f402430" title=

Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great
glory.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And he will send forth his angels with
a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his
chosen from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the
other.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And learn the parable from the
fig-tree: When its branch is already become tender, and puts forth
leaves, ye know that the summer is near. <sup>33</sup>So also ye,
when ye see all these things, know that it is near, at the
doors.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>Verily I say to you, this generation
shall not pass, till all these things are done. <sup>35</sup>Heaven
and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>But of that day and hour no one knows,
not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only. <sup>37</sup>But
as the days of Noah, so shall be also the coming of the Son of man.
<sup>38</sup>For as they were in the days before the flood, eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that
Noah entered into the ark, <sup>39</sup>and knew not until the
flood came, and took all away; so shall be also the coming of the
Son of man. <sup>40</sup>Then shall there be two men in the field,
one is taken, and one is left; <sup>41</sup>two women grinding at
the mill, one is taken, and one is left.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>42</sup>Watch therefore; for ye know not in
what day<sup><a href="#r402442" id="f402442" title="see footnote"

this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the
thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have
suffered his house to be broken through. <sup>44</sup>Therefore be
ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man
comes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>Who then is the faithful and wise
servant, whom his lord set over his household, to give them their
food in due season? <sup>46</sup>Happy that servant, whom his lord
when he comes shall find so doing! <sup>47</sup>Verily I say to
you, that he will set him over all his goods. <sup>48</sup>But if
that evil servant shall say in his heart: My lord delays his
coming; <sup>49</sup>and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants,
and shall eat and drink with the drunken; <sup>50</sup>the lord of
that servant will come in a day when he looks not for it, and in an
hour when he is not aware; <sup>51</sup>and will cut him asunder,
and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There will be the
weeping, and the gnashing of teeth!</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps,
and went out to meet the bridegroom. <sup>2</sup>And five of them
were wise, and five foolish. <sup>3</sup>The foolish, taking their
lamps, took no oil with them; <sup>4</sup>but the wise took oil in
their vessels with their lamps. <sup>5</sup>While the bridegroom
tarried, they all slumbered and slept. <sup>6</sup>And at midnight
a cry was made: Behold, the bridegroom! Go out to meet him.
<sup>7</sup>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
<sup>8</sup>And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil,
for our lamps are going out. <sup>9</sup>But the wise answered,
saying: Not so; there will not be enough for us and you. Go rather
to those who sell, and buy for yourselves. <sup>10</sup>And while
they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they who were ready went
in with him to the marriage; and the door was shut.
<sup>11</sup>And afterward come also the rest of the virgins,
saying: Lord, Lord, open to us. <sup>12</sup>But he answering said:
Verily I say to you, I know you not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Watch, therefore; because ye know not
the day, nor the hour!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>For as a man going abroad called his
own servants, and delivered to them his goods; <sup>15</sup>and to
one gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each
according to his own ability; and straightway went abroad.
<sup>16</sup>And he that received the five talents went and traded
with them, and gained other five talents. <sup>17</sup>Likewise
also he that received the two gained other two. <sup>18</sup>But he
that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid
his lord's money. <sup>19</sup>After a long time the lord of those
servants comes, and reckons with them. <sup>20</sup>And he that
received the five talents came and brought other five talents,
saying: Lord, thou deliveredst to me five talents; behold, I gained
other five talents beside them. <sup>21</sup>His lord said to him:
Well done, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a
little, I will set thee over much. Enter thou into the joy of thy
lord. <sup>22</sup>And he also that received the two talents came
and said: Lord, thou deliveredst to me two talents; behold, I
gained other two talents beside them. <sup>23</sup>His lord said to
him: Well done, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over
a little, I will set thee over much. Enter thou into the joy of thy
lord. <sup>24</sup>And he also that received the one talent came
and said: Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where
thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou strewedst not.
<sup>25</sup>And fearing, I went and hid thy talent in the earth.
Lo, thou hast thine own. <sup>26</sup>And his lord answering said
to him: Wicked and slothful servant! Thou knewest that I reap where
I did not sow, and gather where I strewed not? <sup>27</sup>Thou
oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers; and when
I came, I should have received my own with interest.
<sup>28</sup>Take therefore the talent from him, and give to him
that has the ten talents. <sup>29</sup>For to every one that has
shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that has
not, even what he has shall be taken away. <sup>30</sup>And cast
forth the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will
be the weeping, and the gnashing of teeth!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And when the Son of man shall come in
his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he sit on his
throne of glory. <sup>32</sup>And before him shall be gathered all
the nations; and he will divide them one from another, as the
shepherd divides the sheep from the goats. <sup>33</sup>And he will
set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>Then will the King say to those on his
right hand: Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world. <sup>35</sup>For
I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me
drink; I was a stranger and ye took me in, <sup>36</sup>naked and
ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and
ye came to me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>Then will the righteous answer him,
saying: Lord, when saw we thee hungering and fed thee, or thirsting
and gave thee drink? <sup>38</sup>And when saw we thee a stranger
and took thee in, or naked and clothed thee? <sup>39</sup>And when
saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee? <sup>40</sup>And
the King will answer and say to them: Verily I say to you, inasmuch
as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it to
me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>Then will he say also to those on the
left hand: Depart from me, accursed, into the everlasting fire;
prepared for the Devil and his angels. <sup>42</sup>For I was
hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye did
not give me drink; <sup>43</sup>I was a stranger, and ye did not
take me in; naked, and ye did not clothe me; sick, and in prison,
and ye did not visit me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>Then will they also answer, saying:
Lord, when saw we thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or
naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
<sup>45</sup>Then will he answer them, saying: Verily I say to you,
inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it
not to me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>And these shall go away into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting
life.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

to pass, when Jesus finished all these sayings, he said to his
disciples: <sup>2</sup>Ye know that after two days comes the
passover, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Then assembled together the chief
priests, and the elders of the people, in the court of the high
priest, who was called Caiaphas, <sup>4</sup>and consulted together
that they might take Jesus by craft, and put him to death.
<sup>5</sup>But they said: Not at the feast, that there may not be
a tumult among the people.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And Jesus being in Bethany, in the house
of Simon the leper, <sup>7</sup>there came to him a woman having an
alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head
as he reclined at table. <sup>8</sup>And his disciples seeing it
were displeased, saying: To what purpose is this waste?
<sup>9</sup>For this might have been sold for much, and given to
the poor. <sup>10</sup>And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why
trouble ye the woman? For she wrought a good work upon me.
<sup>11</sup>For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have
not always. <sup>12</sup>For she, in pouring this ointment on my
body, did it to prepare me for burial. <sup>13</sup>Verily I say to
you, wherever this good news shall be preached in the whole world,
this also that she did shall be told, for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Then one of the twelve, called Judas
Iscariot, went to the chief priests, <sup>15</sup>and said: What
will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed
out to him thirty pieces of silver. <sup>16</sup>And from that time
he sought opportunity to deliver him up.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And on the first day of the feast of
unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him: Where
wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
<sup>18</sup>And he said: Go into the city to such a man, and say
to him: The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the
passover at thy house with my disciples. <sup>19</sup>And the
disciples did as Jesus directed them, and made ready the
passover.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And when evening was come, he reclined
at table with the twelve. <sup>21</sup>And as they were eating, he
said: Verily I say to you, that one of you will betray me.
<sup>22</sup>And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began to say
to him, each one: Lord, is it I? <sup>23</sup>And he answering
said: He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will
betray me. <sup>24</sup>The Son of man goes indeed, as it is
written of him; but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is
betrayed! It were good for him, if that man had not been born.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And Judas, his betrayer, answering
said: Rabbi, is it I? He says to him: Thou saidst it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And as they were eating, Jesus took the
loaf<sup><a href="#r402626" id="f402626" title="see footnote" name=
"f402626">26</a></sup>, and blessed, and broke, and gave to the
disciples, and said: Take, eat; this is my body. <sup>27</sup>And
he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink
all ye of it. <sup>28</sup>For this is my blood of the new
covenant<sup><a href="#r402628" id="f402628" title="see footnote"
name="f402628">28</a></sup>, which is shed for many, for remission
of sins. <sup>29</sup>And I say to you, that I will not drink
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink
it new with you, in the kingdom of my Father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And having sung, they went out into the
mount of the Olives.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>Then Jesus says to them: All ye will be
offended because of me this night. For it is written: <span class=
"ot">I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be
scattered abroad.</span> <sup>32</sup>But after I have risen, I
will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Peter answering said to him: Though all
shall be offended because of thee, I will never be offended.
<sup>34</sup>Jesus said to him: Verily I say to thee, that this
night, before a cock crows, thou wilt thrice deny me.
<sup>35</sup>Peter says to him: Even though I should die with thee,
I will not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>Then Jesus comes with them to a place
called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples: Sit ye here, while I
go yonder and pray. <sup>37</sup>And taking with him Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful, and to be troubled.
<sup>38</sup>Then says he to them: My soul is exceedingly
sorrowful, unto death. Tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And going forward a little, he fell on
his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it is possible, let
this cup pass away from me. But yet, not as I will, but as thou
wilt. <sup>40</sup>And he comes to the disciples, and finds them
sleeping; and he says to Peter: Were ye so unable to watch with me
one hour? <sup>41</sup>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>42</sup>Again, a second time, he went away and
prayed, saying: My Father, if this can not pass away from me,
except I drink it, thy will be done. <sup>43</sup>And coming he
again found them sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>And leaving them, he went away again,
and prayed the third time, saying the same words. <sup>45</sup>Then
he comes to his disciples, and says to them: Do ye sleep the
remaining time, and take your rest<sup><a href="#r402645" id=
"f402645" title="see footnote" name="f402645">45</a></sup>! Behold,
the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands
of sinners. <sup>46</sup>Rise, let us be going. Behold, he is at
hand that betrays me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>And while he was yet speaking, behold,
Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with
swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
<sup>48</sup>And his betrayer gave them a sign, saying: Whom I
shall kiss, that is he; hold him fast. <sup>49</sup>And forthwith
he came to Jesus, and said: Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.
<sup>50</sup>And Jesus said to him: Friend, wherefore art thou
come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him fast.
<sup>51</sup>And, behold, one of those who were with Jesus
stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant
of the high priest took off his ear. <sup>52</sup>Then says Jesus
to him: Put back thy sword into its place; for all they who take
the sword shall perish with the sword. <sup>53</sup>Thinkest thou
that I can not now pray to my Father, and he will send<sup><a href=
"#r402653" id="f402653" title="see footnote" name=
"f402653">53</a></sup> me more than twelve legions of angels?
<sup>54</sup>How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus
it must be?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>55</sup>In that hour Jesus said to the
multitudes: Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and
staves, to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple,
and ye did not lay hold of me. <sup>56</sup>But all this has been
done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then
the disciples all forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>57</sup>And they who laid hold of Jesus led him
away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders
were assembled. <sup>58</sup>And Peter followed him afar off, unto
the court of the high priest; and entering in, he sat with the
servants, to see the end.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>59</sup>And the chief priests, and the elders,
and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, that they
might put him to death; <sup>60</sup>and found none, though many
false witnesses came. But at last came two, <sup>61</sup>and said:
This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build
it in three days. <sup>62</sup>And the high priest arose, and said
to him: Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?
<sup>63</sup>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering
said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us
whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God. <sup>64</sup>Jesus
says to him: Thou saidst it. But I say to you, hereafter ye shall
see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming
on the clouds of heaven. <sup>65</sup>Then the high priest rent his
clothes, saying: He blasphemed! What further need have we of
witnesses? Behold, ye now heard his blasphemy. <sup>66</sup>What
think ye? They answering said: He is guilty of death.
<sup>67</sup>Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and
others smote him, <sup>68</sup>saying: Prophesy to us, O Christ,
who is he that struck thee?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>69</sup>And Peter was sitting without, in the
court. And a damsel came to him, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus
the Galil&aelig;an. <sup>70</sup>But he denied before all, saying:
I know not what thou sayest. <sup>71</sup>And he having gone out
into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to those who were
there: This man also was with Jesus the Nazarene. <sup>72</sup>And
again he denied, with an oath: I do not know the man.
<sup>73</sup>And after a little while, they that stood by came and
said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech
betrays thee. <sup>74</sup>Then he began to invoke curses, and to
swear: I do not know the man. And immediately a cock crowed.
<sup>75</sup>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus when he said:
Before a cock crows, thou wilt thrice deny me. And he went out, and
wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXVII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> when
morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people
took counsel against Jesus, so as to put him to death.
<sup>2</sup>And having bound him, they led him away, and delivered
him up to Pontius Pilate the governor.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he
saw that he was condemned, repenting brought back the thirty pieces
of silver to the chief priests and the elders, <sup>4</sup>saying:
I sinned in betraying innocent blood. And they said: What is it to
us? Look thou to it. <sup>5</sup>And casting down the pieces of
silver in the temple, he departed; and he went away and hanged
himself. <sup>6</sup>And the chief priests took the silver pieces,
and said: It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it
is the price of blood. <sup>7</sup>And they took counsel, and
bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
<sup>8</sup>Wherefore that field was called the field of blood,
unto this day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</p>
<p class="pp1">And they took the thirty pieces of silver,</p>
<p class="pp1">The price of him that was priced,</p>
<p class="pp1">Whom they of the sons of Israel did price,</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>10</sup>And gave them for the potter's field,
as the Lord appointed to me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And Jesus stood before the governor.
And the governor questioned him, saying: Art thou the king of the
Jews? And Jesus said to him: Thou sayest it. <sup>12</sup>And when
he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he made no
answer. <sup>13</sup>Then says Pilate to him: Hearest thou not what
things they witness against thee? <sup>14</sup>And he made him no
answer, not even to one word; so that the governor greatly
wondered.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Now at the feast the governor was wont
to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.
<sup>16</sup>And they had then a noted prisoner, called Barabbas.
<sup>17</sup>When therefore they were assembled, Pilate said to
them: Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is
called Christ? <sup>18</sup>For he knew that through envy they
delivered him up.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And as he sat on the judgment-seat, his
wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with that just man;
for I suffered much this day, in a dream, because of him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And the chief priests and the elders
persuaded the multitudes, that they should ask for Barabbas, and
should destroy Jesus. <sup>21</sup>And the governor answering said
to them: Which of the two will ye that I release to you? And they
said: Barabbas. <sup>22</sup>Pilate says to them: What then shall I
do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say to him: Let him
be crucified. <sup>23</sup>And the governor said: What evil then
did he? But they cried the more, saying: Let him be crucified.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And Pilate, seeing that it avails
nothing, but rather that a tumult is made, took water and washed
his hands before the multitude, saying: I am innocent of the blood
of this just man. Look ye to it. <sup>25</sup>And all the people
answering said: His blood be on us, and on our children.
<sup>26</sup>Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus, having
scourged him, he delivered up to be crucified.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Then the soldiers of the governor took
Jesus into the Pretorium, and gathered to him the whole band.
<sup>28</sup>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
<sup>29</sup>And having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on
his head, and a reed in his right hand; and bowing the knee before
him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, King of the Jews!
<sup>30</sup>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote
him on the head. <sup>31</sup>And when they had mocked him, they
took off the robe from him, and put on him his own garments, and
led him away to crucify him. <sup>32</sup>And as they came out they
found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to bear
his cross.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And having come to a place called
Golgotha (which is called, Place of a skull), <sup>34</sup>they
gave him vinegar to drink<sup><a href="#r402734" id="f402734"
title="see footnote" name="f402734">34</a></sup>, mingled with
gall; and tasting it, he would not drink. <sup>35</sup>And having
crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lots.
<sup>36</sup>And sitting down, they watched him there.
<sup>37</sup>And they set up over his head his accusation, written:
THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>Two robbers are then crucified with
him, one on the right hand, and one on the left. <sup>39</sup>And
those passing by reviled him, wagging their heads, <sup>40</sup>and
saying: Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
days, save thyself. If thou art the Son of God, come down from the
cross. <sup>41</sup>Likewise also the chief priests mocking, with
the scribes and elders, said: <sup>42</sup>Others he saved, himself
he can not save. If he is King of Israel, let him now come down
from the cross, and we will believe on him. <sup>43</sup>He trusts
in God; let him now deliver him, if he desires him; for he said I
am the Son of God. <sup>44</sup>And also the robbers, who were
crucified with him, reproached him with the same thing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>And from the sixth hour, there was
darkness over all the land, unto the ninth hour. <sup>46</sup>And
about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying:
<span class="ot">Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?</span> That is:
<span class="ot">My God, my God, why didst thou forsake me?</span>
<sup>47</sup>Some of those standing there, hearing it, said: This
man calls for Elijah<sup><a href="#r402747" id="f402747" title=
"see footnote" name="f402747">47</a></sup>. <sup>48</sup>And
straightway one of them ran and took a sponge, and having filled it
with vinegar and put it on a reed, gave him to drink.
<sup>49</sup>But the rest said: Let alone; let us see whether
Elijah comes to save him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>50</sup>And Jesus, again crying with a loud
voice, yielded up his spirit. <sup>51</sup>And behold, the vail of
the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the
earth quaked, and the rocks were rent; <sup>52</sup>and the tombs
were opened, and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep
arose, <sup>53</sup>and coming out of the tombs, after his
resurrection, went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>54</sup>And the centurion, and they that with
him were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake, and the things
that were done, were exceedingly afraid, saying: Truly this was the
Son of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>55</sup>And many women were there, beholding
afar off, they who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him;
<sup>56</sup>among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother
of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>57</sup>And evening having come, there came a
rich man from Arimath&aelig;a, named Joseph, who also himself was a
disciple of Jesus. <sup>58</sup>This man went to Pilate, and asked
for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should
be given up. <sup>59</sup>And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in
a clean linen cloth, <sup>60</sup>and laid it in his own new tomb,
which he hewed out in the rock. And having rolled a great stone to
the door of the tomb, he departed. <sup>61</sup>And Mary the
Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the
sepulchre.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>62</sup>And on the morrow, which is after the
preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to
Pilate, <sup>63</sup>saying: Sir, we remember that that deceiver
said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise.
<sup>64</sup>Command, therefore, that the sepulchre be made secure
until the third day lest his disciples come and steal him away, and
say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error
will be worse than the first. <sup>65</sup>Pilate said to them: Ye
have a watch; go, make secure, as ye know how. <sup>66</sup>And
they went, and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone, in
connection with the watch.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXVIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> late in
the sabbath, as it was dawning into the first day of the week, came
Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary to view the sepulchre.
<sup>2</sup>And behold, there was a great earthquake. For an angel
of the Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the
stone, and sat upon it. <sup>3</sup>His countenance was like
lightning, and his raiment white as snow; <sup>4</sup>and for fear
of him the keepers shook, and became as dead men. <sup>5</sup>And
the angel answering said to the women: Fear not ye; for I know that
ye are seeking Jesus, who was crucified. <sup>6</sup>He is not
here; for he is risen, as he said. Come hither, see the place where
the Lord lay. <sup>7</sup>And go quickly, and tell his disciples
that he is risen from the dead. And behold, he goes before you into
Galilee; there ye shall see him. Behold, I told you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And going out quickly from the
sepulchre, with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples
word. <sup>9</sup>And behold, Jesus met them, saying: All hail! And
they, coming to him, laid hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
<sup>10</sup>Then Jesus says to them: Be not afraid; go, bear word
to my brethren, to go away into Galilee, and there they shall see
me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And as they were going, behold, some of
the watch came into the city, and reported to the chief priests all
the things that were done. <sup>12</sup>And having assembled with
the elders, and taken counsel, they gave much money to the
soldiers, <sup>13</sup>saying: Say, that his disciples came by
night, and stole him away while we slept. <sup>14</sup>And if this
shall be heard by the governor<sup><a href="#r402814" id="f402814"
title="see footnote" name="f402814">14</a></sup>, we will persuade
him, and make you secure. <sup>15</sup>And they, taking the money,
did as they were taught. And this saying was reported abroad among
the Jews, until this day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And the eleven disciples went away into
Galilee, into the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
<sup>17</sup>And seeing him, they worshiped him; but some
doubted.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And Jesus came and spoke to them,
saying: All power was given to me in heaven and on earth.
<sup>19</sup>Go therefore, and disciple all the nations, immersing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit; <sup>20</sup>teaching them to observe all things, whatever
I commanded you. And, behold, I am with you alway, unto the end of
the world.</p>

the wilderness, and preaching the immersion of repentance unto
remission of sins. <sup>5</sup>And there went out to him all the
country of Jud&aelig;a, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were
immersed by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And John was clothed with camel's hair,
and with a leathern girdle about his loins, and ate locusts and
wild honey. <sup>7</sup>And he preached, saying: There comes after
me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am
not worthy to stoop down and loose. <sup>8</sup>I indeed immersed
you in water; but he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And it came to pass in those days, that
Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in
the Jordan. <sup>10</sup>And straightway coming up out of the
water, he saw the heavens parted, and the Spirit as a dove
descending upon him. <sup>11</sup>And there came a voice out of
heaven: Thou art my beloved son; in thee I am well pleased.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And immediately the Spirit drives him
forth into the wilderness. <sup>13</sup>And he was in the
wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild
beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And after John was delivered up, Jesus
came into Galilee, publishing the good news of the kingdom of
God<sup><a href="#r410114" id="f410114" title="see footnote" name=

in the good news.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he
saw Simon, and Andrew, Simon's brother, casting a net in the sea;
for they were fishermen. <sup>17</sup>And Jesus said to them: Come
after me, and I will cause you to become fishers of men.
<sup>18</sup>And immediately leaving the nets, they followed
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And going a little further, he saw
James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in
the ship mending the nets. <sup>20</sup>And straightway he called
them; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired
servants, they went after him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And they enter into Capernaum; and
straightway on the sabbath he went into the synagogue, and taught.

taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And there was in their synagogue a man

and come out of him. <sup>26</sup>And the unclean spirit, tearing
him, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.

<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And immediately, having come out of the
synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with
James and John. <sup>30</sup>And the mother-in-law of Simon was
lying sick with fever; and immediately they tell him concerning
her. <sup>31</sup>And he came and raised her up, taking hold of her
hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to
them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And evening having come, when the sun
set, they brought to him all that were sick, and those possessed
with demons. <sup>33</sup>And all the city was gathered together at
the door. <sup>34</sup>And he healed many that were sick with
divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and suffered not the
demons to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And rising very early, by night, he
went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
<sup>36</sup>And Simon, and they who were with him, followed after
him. <sup>37</sup>And having found him, they say to him: All are
seeking thee. <sup>38</sup>And he says to them: Let us go
elsewhere, into the neighboring towns, that I may preach there
also; for, for this I came forth. <sup>39</sup>And he was preaching
in their synagogues, throughout all Galilee, and casting out the
demons.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>And there came a leper to him,
beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him: If
thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me. <sup>41</sup>And Jesus, moved
with compassion, stretched forth his hand and touched him, and says
to him: I will; be thou cleansed. <sup>42</sup>And immediately the
leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. <sup>43</sup>And
sternly charging him, he forthwith sent him away; <sup>44</sup>and
says to him: See thou say nothing to any one; but go, show thyself
to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses commanded,
for a testimony to them. <sup>45</sup>But he, going forth, began to
publish it much, and to spread abroad the report; so that he could
no longer openly enter into a city, but was without in desert
places. And they came to him from every quarter.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> again he
entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was heard that he is
in the house. <sup>2</sup>And straightway many were gathered
together, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door;
and he spoke the word to them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And they come to him, bringing one that
was palsied, borne by four. <sup>4</sup>And not being able to come
near him, on account of the multitude, they uncovered the roof
where he was; and having broken it up, they let down the bed
whereon the palsied man lay. <sup>5</sup>And Jesus, seeing their
faith, says to the palsied man: Child, thy sins are forgiven.
<sup>6</sup>But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and
reasoning in their hearts: <sup>7</sup>Why does this man speak
thus? He blasphemes. Who can forgive sins but one, God?
<sup>8</sup>And Jesus, immediately perceiving in his spirit that
they so reasoned within themselves, said to them: Why reason ye
these things in your hearts? <sup>9</sup>Which is easier, to say to
the palsied man, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take
up thy bed, and walk? <sup>10</sup>But that ye may know that the
Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he says to the
palsied man,) <sup>11</sup>I say to thee, arise, take up thy bed,
and go to thy house. <sup>12</sup>And he arose, and immediately
taking up the bed went forth before all; so that all were amazed,
and glorified God, saying: We never saw it thus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And he went forth again by the
sea-side; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught
them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And passing along, he saw Levi the son
of Alpheus sitting at the place of receiving custom, and said to
him: Follow me. And rising up he followed him. <sup>15</sup>And it
came to pass, as he reclined at table in his house, that many
publicans and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples;
for there were many, and they followed him. <sup>16</sup>And the
scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with the sinners and
publicans, said to his disciples: How is it that he eats and drinks
with the sinners and the publicans? <sup>17</sup>And Jesus, hearing
it, says to them: They who are well need not a physician, but they
who are sick. I came not to call righteous men, but sinners.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And the disciples of John, and the
Pharisees, were fasting<sup><a href="#r410218" id="f410218" title=
"see footnote" name="f410218">18</a></sup>; and they come and say
to him: Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but
thy disciples fast not? <sup>19</sup>And Jesus said to them: Can
the sons of the bridechamber fast<sup><a href="#r410219" id=
"f410219" title="see footnote" name="f410219">19</a></sup>, while
the bridegroom is with them? So long as they have the bridegroom
with them, they can not fast. <sup>20</sup>But days will come, when
the bridegroom will be taken from them; and then they will fast in
that day. <sup>21</sup>No one sews a piece of unfulled cloth upon
an old garment; else the new filling up of the old takes from it,
and a worse rent is made. <sup>22</sup>And no one puts new wine
into old skins; else the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is
destroyed, and the skins<sup><a href="#r410222" id="f410222" title=
"see footnote" name="f410222">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And it came to pass, that he went
through the grain-fields on the sabbath; and his disciples began to
go forward<sup><a href="#r410223" id="f410223" title="see footnote"
name="f410223">23</a></sup>, plucking the ears of grain.
<sup>24</sup>And the Pharisees said to him: Behold, why do they on
the sabbath that which is not lawful? <sup>25</sup>And he said to
them: Did ye never read what David did, when he had need and
hungered, himself and they who were with him; <sup>26</sup>how he
went into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the high
priest, and ate the show-bread, which it is not lawful to eat but
for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?
<sup>27</sup>And he said to them: The sabbath was made for man, and
not man for the sabbath. <sup>28</sup>So that the Son of man is
Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> he entered
again into the synagogue; and there was a man there, having his
hand withered. <sup>2</sup>And they watched him, whether he would
heal him on the sabbath; that they might accuse him.
<sup>3</sup>And he says to the man having the withered hand: Arise,
and come into the midst. <sup>4</sup>And he says to them: Is it
lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil; to save life, or
to kill? But they were silent. <sup>5</sup>And looking round on
them with anger, being grieved for their hardness of heart, he says
to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and
his hand was restored.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And going out, the Pharisees immediately
took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy
him. <sup>7</sup>And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea.
And a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Jud&aelig;a,
<sup>8</sup>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond
the Jordan, and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude,
hearing what great things he did, came to him. <sup>9</sup>And he
spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him
because of the multitude, that they might not throng him.
<sup>10</sup>For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him to
touch him, as many as had plagues. <sup>11</sup>And the unclean
spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried,
saying: Thou art the Son of God. <sup>12</sup>And he strictly
charged them that they should not make him known.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And he goes up into the mountain, and
calls to him whom he would; and they went to him. <sup>14</sup>And
he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he
might send them forth to preach, <sup>15</sup>and to have authority
to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons. <sup>16</sup>And Simon
he surnamed Peter; <sup>17</sup>and James the son of Zebedee, and
John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which
is, Sons of thunder; <sup>18</sup>and Andrew, and Philip, and
Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus,
and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananite<sup><a href="#r410318" id=

<sup>19</sup>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>
<p class="pin">And they come into the house. <sup>20</sup>And the
multitude comes together again, so that they could not even eat
bread. <sup>21</sup>And hearing of it, his kinsmen went out to lay
hold of him; for they said: He is beside himself.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And the scribes who came down from
Jerusalem said: He has Beelzebul, and through the prince of the
demons he casts out the demons. <sup>23</sup>And calling them to
him, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?
<sup>24</sup>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that
kingdom can not stand. <sup>25</sup>And if a house be divided
against itself, that house can not stand. <sup>26</sup>And if Satan
rose up against himself, and is divided, he can not stand, but has
an end. <sup>27</sup>No one can enter into a strong man's house,
and plunder his goods, except he first bind the strong man; and
then he will plunder his house. <sup>28</sup>Verily I say to you,
all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and the blasphemies
wherewith they shall blaspheme. <sup>29</sup>But he that shall
blaspheme against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but
is guilty of eternal sin; <sup>30</sup>because they said: He has an
unclean spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And his brothers and his mother come;
and standing without they sent to him, calling him.
<sup>32</sup>And a crowd was sitting about him; and they say to
him: Behold, thy mother and thy brothers without are seeking thee.
<sup>33</sup>And he answered them, saying: Who is my mother, or my
brothers? <sup>34</sup>And looking round on those who sat about
him, he said: Behold my mother, and my brothers! <sup>35</sup>For
whoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and
mother.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> he began
again to teach by the sea-side. And there was gathered to him a
very great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat down
in the sea; and all the multitude was by the sea on the land.
<sup>2</sup>And he taught them many things in parables, and said to
them in his teaching:</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Hearken; behold, the sower went forth to
sow. <sup>4</sup>And it came to pass, as he sowed, one fell by the
way-side, and the birds came and devoured it. <sup>5</sup>And
another fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth; and
immediately it sprang up, because it had not depth of earth.
<sup>6</sup>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because
it had not root, it withered away. <sup>7</sup>And another fell
among the thorns; and the thorns came up, and choked it, and it
yielded no fruit. <sup>8</sup>And another fell into the good
ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought
forth, thirty, and sixty, and a hundredfold. <sup>9</sup>And he
said: He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And when he was alone, they who were
about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables.
<sup>11</sup>And he said to them: To you is given the mystery of
the kingdom of God, but to those who are without, all things are
done in parables; <sup>12</sup>that seeing they may see, and not
perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply
they should turn, and be forgiven. <sup>13</sup>And he says to
them: Know ye not this parable? And how will ye know all the
parables?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>The sower sows the word.
<sup>15</sup>And these are they by the way-side; where the word is
sown, and when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away
the word that was sown in them. <sup>16</sup>And these are they
likewise that are sown on the rocky places; who, when they hear the
word, immediately receive it with gladness; <sup>17</sup>and have
no root in themselves, but are only for a time. Afterward, when
affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately
they are offended. <sup>18</sup>And others are they that are sown
among the thorns. These are they that hear the word,
<sup>19</sup>and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of
riches, and the lusts of other things, entering in choke the word,
and it becomes unfruitful. <sup>20</sup>And these are they that are
sown on the good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and
bring forth fruit, in thirty, and in sixty, and in a
hundredfold.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And he said to them: Is the lamp
brought that it may be put under the bushel, or under the bed? Is
it not, that it may be put on the lamp-stand? <sup>22</sup>For
nothing is hidden, but it shall be manifested; nor was done in
secret, but that it should come abroad. <sup>23</sup>If any one has
ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And he said to them: Take heed what ye
hear. With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you, and
there shall be added to you. <sup>25</sup>For he that has, to him
shall be given; and he that has not, even what he has shall be
taken from him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And he said: So is the kingdom of God,
as when a man has cast the seed upon the earth, <sup>27</sup>and
sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows up,
he knows not how. <sup>28</sup>For the earth brings forth fruit of
herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the
ear. <sup>29</sup>But when the fruit permits, immediately he puts
forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And he said: How shall we liken the
kingdom of God, or in what comparison shall we set it forth?
<sup>31</sup>As a grain of mustard; which, when it is sown in the
earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.
<sup>32</sup>And when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater
than all the herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the
birds of the air can lodge under its shadow.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And with many such parables he spoke
the word to them, as they were able to hear. <sup>34</sup>But
without a parable he spoke not to them; and in private he explained
all things to his disciples.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And on that day, when evening was come,
he says to them: Let us pass over to the other side.
<sup>36</sup>And dismissing the multitude, they take him as he was
in the ship. And there were also other ships with him.
<sup>37</sup>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves
beat into the ship, so that the ship was already becoming filled.
<sup>38</sup>And he was in the stern, on the cushion, sleeping. And
they awake him, and say to him: Teacher, carest thou not that we
perish? <sup>39</sup>And awaking, he rebuked the wind, and said to
the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a
great calm. <sup>40</sup>And he said to them: Why are ye so
fearful? How is it that ye have no faith? <sup>41</sup>And they
feared exceedingly, and said one to another: Who then is this, that
even the wind and the sea obey him?</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=
"sc">nd</span> they came to the other side of the sea, into the
country of the Gerasenes. <sup>2</sup>And when he had come out of
the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an
unclean spirit, <sup>3</sup>who had his dwelling in the tombs; and
no one could any longer bind him, not even with chains.
<sup>4</sup>Because he had often been bound with fetters and
chains; and the chains had been torn asunder by him, and the
fetters broken in pieces, and no one could tame him.
<sup>5</sup>And always, night and day, he was in the tombs, and in
the mountains, crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
<sup>6</sup>But seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and bowed down to
him, <sup>7</sup>and cried with a loud voice, and said: What have I
to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by
God, do not torment me. <sup>8</sup>For he said to him: Come forth,
unclean spirit, out of the man. <sup>9</sup>And he asked him: What
is thy name? And he says to him: My name is Legion; because we are
many. <sup>10</sup>And he besought him much that he would not send
them away out of the country.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And there was there, by the mountain, a
great herd of swine feeding. <sup>12</sup>And all the demons
besought him, saying: Send us into the swine, that we may enter
into them. <sup>13</sup>And immediately Jesus gave them leave. And
coming out, the unclean spirits entered into the swine. And the
herd rushed down the steep into the sea, about two thousand, and
were choked in the sea. <sup>14</sup>And they who fed them fled,
and reported it in the city and in the country. And they came to
see what it was that was done. <sup>15</sup>And they come to Jesus,
and see him who was possessed with demons, sitting, clothed and in
his right mind, him who had the legion, and they were afraid.
<sup>16</sup>And they who saw it related to them how it befell him
who was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.
<sup>17</sup>And they began to beseech him to depart from their
borders.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And as he was entering into the ship,
he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might
be with him. <sup>19</sup>And he suffered him not; but says to him:
Go into thy house, to thy friends, and announce to them how great
things the Lord has done for thee, and had compassion on thee.
<sup>20</sup>And he departed, and began to publish in the Decapolis
how great things Jesus did for him; and all wondered.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And Jesus having passed over again in
the ship to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him;
and he was by the sea. <sup>22</sup>And there comes one of the
rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name. And seeing him, he fell at
his feet, <sup>23</sup>and besought him much, saying: My little
daughter lies at the point of death. I pray thee come, and lay thy
hands on her, that she may be healed and live. <sup>24</sup>And he
went with him; and a great multitude was following him, and
thronging him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And a certain woman, who had a flow of
blood twelve years, <sup>26</sup>and had suffered much by many
physicians, and spent all that she had, and was not at all
benefited but rather grew worse, <sup>27</sup>hearing of Jesus,
came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. <sup>28</sup>For
she said: If I touch even his garments, I shall be made whole.
<sup>29</sup>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried
up; and she perceived in her body that she was healed of that
plague. <sup>30</sup>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself
that power had gone forth from him, turned about in the crowd, and
said: Who touched my garments? <sup>31</sup>And his disciples said
to him: Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou:
Who touched me? <sup>32</sup>And he looked around to see her who
had done this. <sup>33</sup>But the woman, fearing and trembling,
knowing what was done to her, came and fell down before him, and
told him all the truth. <sup>34</sup>And he said to her: Daughter,
thy faith has made thee whole; go in peace, and be healed of thy
plague.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>While he was yet speaking, they come
from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying: Thy daughter is
dead; why troublest thou the Teacher any further? <sup>36</sup>And
Jesus, overhearing the word that was spoken, says to the ruler of
the synagogue: Be not afraid; only believe. <sup>37</sup>And he
suffered no one to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John
the brother of James. <sup>38</sup>And they come to the house of
the ruler of the synagogue; and he sees a tumult, and those who
wept and wailed greatly. <sup>39</sup>And entering in, he says to
them: Why do ye make a tumult, and weep? The child is not dead, but
is sleeping. <sup>40</sup>And they laughed him to scorn. But he,
putting them all out, takes the father of the child, and the
mother, and those who were with him, and enters in where the child
was. <sup>41</sup>And taking the hand of the child, he says to her:
Talitha kumi; which is interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, arise.
<sup>42</sup>And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she
was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a
great astonishment. <sup>43</sup>And he charged them strictly that
no one should know this. And he commanded that something should be
given her to eat.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> he went out
from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples
follow him. <sup>2</sup>And when the sabbath was come, he began to
teach in the synagogue. And many hearing were astonished, saying:
From whence has this man these things? And what is the wisdom which
is given him, and such miracles wrought by his hands?
<sup>3</sup>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother
of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And are not his sisters
here with us? And they were offended at him. <sup>4</sup>And Jesus
said to them: A prophet is not without honor, except in his own
country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house.
<sup>5</sup>And he was not able to do any miracle there, save that
he laid his hands on a few sick, and healed them. <sup>6</sup>And
he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went about the
surrounding villages, teaching.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And he called to him the twelve, and
began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them authority
over the unclean spirits; <sup>8</sup>and commanded them that they
should take nothing for the way, save a staff only; no bread, no
bag, no money, in their girdle; <sup>9</sup>but that they be shod
with sandals and, Put not on two coats. <sup>10</sup>And he said to
them: Wherever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart
from thence. <sup>11</sup>And whatever place shall not receive you,
nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your
feet for a testimony to them<sup><a href="#r410611" id="f410611"

<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And they went out, and preached that
men should repent. <sup>13</sup>And they cast out many demons, and
anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And the king, Herod, heard of it, for
his name was spread abroad; and he said: John the Immerser is risen
from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.
<sup>15</sup>Others said: It is Elijah. And others said: It is a
prophet, like any one of the prophets. <sup>16</sup>But Herod
hearing of it, said: John, whom I beheaded, is risen from the dead.
<sup>17</sup>For he, Herod, sent forth and laid hold of John, and
bound him in prison, for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip,
his brother; because he had married her. <sup>18</sup>For John said
to Herod: It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
<sup>19</sup>And Herodias was angry with him, and desired to put
him to death; and she could not, <sup>20</sup>for Herod feared
John, knowing that he was a just and holy man; and he observed
him<sup><a href="#r410620" id="f410620" title="see footnote" name=
"f410620">20</a></sup>, and hearing him did many things, and heard
him gladly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And a convenient day having come, when
Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, and for the
chief captains, and the first men of Galilee; <sup>22</sup>and the
daughter of Herodias having come in and danced, it pleased Herod
and those reclining at table with him; and the king said to the
damsel: Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
<sup>23</sup>And he swore to her: Whatever thou shalt ask of me, I
will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. <sup>24</sup>And
she, going out, said to her mother: What shall I ask? And she said:
The head of John the Immerser. <sup>25</sup>And straightway she
came in with haste to the king, and asked, saying: I will that
immediately thou give me, on a platter, the head of John the
Immerser. <sup>26</sup>And the king became very sorrowful; but for
the sake of his oath, and of those reclining with him, he would not
reject her. <sup>27</sup>And immediately the king sent one of the
guard, and commanded to bring his head. And he went and beheaded
him in the prison, <sup>28</sup>and brought his head on a platter,
and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.
<sup>29</sup>And his disciples hearing of it came and took up his
corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And the apostles gather together unto
Jesus; and they reported to him all things, both what they did, and
what they taught. <sup>31</sup>And he said to them: Come ye
yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile; for there
were many coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.
<sup>32</sup>And they departed into a desert place by ship
privately. <sup>33</sup>And they saw them departing, and many knew
them, and ran together there on foot from all the cities, and came
before them. <sup>34</sup>And going forth he saw a great multitude,
and had compassion on them, because they were as sheep having no
shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And the day being now far spent, his
disciples come to him, and say: The place is desert, and the time
is now far passed. <sup>36</sup>Dismiss them, that they may go away
into the surrounding fields and villages, and buy themselves bread;
for they have nothing to eat. <sup>37</sup>He answering said to
them: Give ye them to eat. And they say to him: Shall we go and buy
two hundred den&aacute;ries worth of bread, and give them to eat?
<sup>38</sup>He says to them: How many loaves have ye? Go and see.
And when they knew, they say: Five, and two fishes.
<sup>39</sup>And he commanded them to make all lie down by
companies on the green grass. <sup>40</sup>And they lay down in
ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. <sup>41</sup>And taking the
five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed
and broke the loaves, and gave to the disciples to set before them;
and the two fishes he divided among them all. <sup>42</sup>And they
all ate, and were filled. <sup>43</sup>And they took up fragments
filling twelve baskets, and part of the fishes. <sup>44</sup>And
they who ate of the loaves were five thousand men. <sup>45</sup>And
straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the ship,
and to go before to the other side to Bethsaida, while he dismissed
the multitude. <sup>46</sup>And having taken leave of them, he went
away into the mountain to pray.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>And when evening was come, the ship was
in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.
<sup>48</sup>And he saw them distressed in rowing, for the wind was
contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night he comes
to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.
<sup>49</sup>And they seeing him walking on the sea, supposed it
was a spectre, and cried out; <sup>50</sup>for all saw him, and
were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and says to
them: Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid. <sup>51</sup>And he
went up to them into the ship; and the wind ceased. And they were
sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
<sup>52</sup>For they considered not the loaves; for their heart
was hardened.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>53</sup>And passing over, they came to the land
of Gennesaret, and anchored there. <sup>54</sup>And when they had
come out of the ship, immediately recognizing him <sup>55</sup>they
ran through all that region, and began to carry about on beds those
who were sick, where they heard he was. <sup>56</sup>And wherever
he entered, into villages, or cities, or fields, they laid the sick
in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it
were but the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were
made whole.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> there come
together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes, who came
from Jerusalem. <sup>2</sup>And seeing some of his disciples eating
bread with defiled (that is, unwashen) hands, they found fault.
<sup>3</sup>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they
carefully wash their hands, do not eat, holding the tradition of
the elders. <sup>4</sup>And coming from the market, except they
immerse themselves, they do not eat. And there are many other
things which they received to hold, immersions of cups, and pots,
and brazen vessels, and couches. <sup>5</sup>And the Pharisees and
the scribes ask him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the
tradition of the elders, but eat bread with defiled hands?
<sup>6</sup>And he said to them: Well did Isaiah prophesy
concerning you hypocrites; as it is written:</p>
<p class="pp2">This people honor me with their lips,</p>
<p class="pp2">But their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>7</sup>But in vain they worship me,</p>
<p class="pp2">Teaching as doctrines commandments of men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>For laying aside the commandment of God,
ye hold the tradition of men, immersions of pots and cups; and many
other such things ye do. <sup>9</sup>And he said to them: Well do
ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own
tradition! <sup>10</sup>For Moses said: <span class="ot">Honor thy
father and thy mother;</span> and <span class="ot">he that curses
father or mother, let him surely die.</span> <sup>11</sup>But ye
say: If a man say to his father or his mother, It is Corban (that
is, a gift) whatever thou mightest be profited with from
me&mdash;<sup><a href="#r410711" id="f410711" title="see footnote"
name="f410711">11</a></sup>; <sup>12</sup>and ye suffer him no more
to do aught for his father or his mother, <sup>13</sup>annulling
the word of God by your tradition, which ye handed down. And many
such things ye do.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And again calling to him the multitude,
he said to them: Hearken to me every one, and understand.
<sup>15</sup>There is nothing from without a man, that entering
into him can defile him; but the things that come out of him, these
are they that defile the man. <sup>16</sup>If any one has ears to
hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And when he entered into the house from
the multitude, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
<sup>18</sup>And he says to them: Are ye so without understanding
also? Do ye not perceive, that whatever from without enters into
the man can not defile him? <sup>19</sup>Because it enters not into
his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the drain,
cleansing all food. <sup>20</sup>And he said: That which comes out
of the man, that defiles the man. <sup>21</sup>For from within, out
of the heart of men, come forth evil thoughts, adulteries,
fornications, murders, <sup>22</sup>thefts, covetousness,
wickedness, deceit, wantonness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride,
foolishness. <sup>23</sup>All these evil things come forth from
within, and defile the man.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And rising up he departed thence into
the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and entering into a house, he
desired that no one should know it. And he could not be hidden.
<sup>25</sup>For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean
spirit, hearing of him, came and fell at his feet. <sup>26</sup>The
woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him
that he would cast out the demon from her daughter.
<sup>27</sup>And he said to her: Let the children first be filled;
for it is not good to take the children's bread and cast it to the
dogs. <sup>28</sup>And she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for
the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
<sup>29</sup>And he said to her: For this saying go thy way; the
demon has gone out of thy daughter. <sup>30</sup>And departing to
her house, she found the little child laid on the bed, and the
demon gone out.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And again going forth out of the
borders of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee,
through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. <sup>32</sup>And
they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his
speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
<sup>33</sup>And taking him aside from the multitude he put his
fingers into his ears, and spitting, touched his tongue,
<sup>34</sup>and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him:
Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. <sup>35</sup>And straightway his
ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he
spoke plainly. <sup>36</sup>And he charged them that they should
tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more abundantly they
published it; <sup>37</sup>and were beyond measure astonished,
saying: He has done all things well; he makes both the deaf to
hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I<span class="sc">n</span> those
days, there being a very great multitude, and they having nothing
to eat, he called to him his disciples, and says to them:
<sup>2</sup>I have compassion on the multitude, because they
continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat;
<sup>3</sup>and if I dismiss them fasting to their own houses, they
will faint by the way; and some of them have come from afar.
<sup>4</sup>And his disciples answered him: From whence will one be
able to satisfy these men with bread, here in a wilderness?
<sup>5</sup>And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? And they
said: Seven. <sup>6</sup>And he commanded the multitude to lie down
on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and
broke, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they set
them before the multitude. <sup>7</sup>And they had a few small
fishes; and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also
before them. <sup>8</sup>And they ate, and were filled; and they
took up of the fragments that were left seven baskets.
<sup>9</sup>And they were about four thousand. And he dismissed
them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And straightway entering into the ship
with his disciples, he came into the region of Dalmanutha.
<sup>11</sup>And the Pharisees came out, and began to question with
him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
<sup>12</sup>And sighing deeply in his spirit, he says: Why does
this generation seek a sign? Verily I say to you, there shall no
sign be given to this generation. <sup>13</sup>And leaving them, he
entered again into the ship, and departed to the other side.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And they forgot to take bread; and they
had none in the ship with them, except one loaf. <sup>15</sup>And
he charged them, saying: Take heed, beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. <sup>16</sup>And they reasoned
among themselves, saying: It is because we have no bread.
<sup>17</sup>And Jesus knowing it, says to them: Why reason ye,
because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive, nor understand?
Have ye your heart yet hardened? <sup>18</sup>Having eyes, do ye
not see? And having ears, do ye not hear? And do ye not remember?
<sup>19</sup>When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand,
how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? They say to him:
Twelve. <sup>20</sup>And when the seven among the four thousand,
how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up? And they said:
Seven. <sup>21</sup>And he said to them: How is it that ye do not
understand?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And they come to Bethsaida. And they
bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him.
<sup>23</sup>And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him forth
out of the village; and spitting in his eyes, and putting his hands
on him, he asked him if he beheld anything. <sup>24</sup>And
looking up he said: I behold men; for I see them as trees walking.
<sup>25</sup>Then again he put his hands on his eyes, and he saw
clearly; and he was restored, and saw all things distinctly.
<sup>26</sup>And he sent him away to his house, saying: Go not even
into the village, nor tell it to any in the village.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And Jesus went out, and his disciples,
into the villages of C&aelig;sarea Philippi: And in the way he
asked his disciples, saying to them: Who do men say that I am?
<sup>28</sup>And they answered him saying: John the Immerser; and
others, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets. <sup>29</sup>And
he asked them: But who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering
says to him: Thou art the Christ. <sup>30</sup>And he charged them
that they should tell no one concerning him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And he began to teach them, that the
Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders,
and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after
three days rise again. <sup>32</sup>And he spoke that saying
openly. And Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him.
<sup>33</sup>But he turning about, and seeing his disciples,
rebuked Peter, saying: Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou thinkest
not the things of God, but those of men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>And calling to him the multitude, with
his disciples, he said to them: Whoever desires to follow after me,
let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
<sup>35</sup>For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but
whoever shall lose his life, for the sake of me and of the glad
tidings, shall save it. <sup>36</sup>For what will it profit a man,
to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? <sup>37</sup>Or what
shall a man give as an exchange for his soul? <sup>38</sup>For
whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous
and sinful generation, of him will also the Son of man be ashamed,
when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

them: Verily I say to you, that there are some of those standing
here, who shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom
of God already come with power.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And after six days Jesus takes with him
Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain
apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them.
<sup>3</sup>And his garments became shining, exceeding white as
snow, such as no fuller on earth can whiten. <sup>4</sup>And there
appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking with
Jesus. <sup>5</sup>And Peter answering said to Jesus: Master, it is
good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee,
and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. <sup>6</sup>For he knew not
what to say; for they were sore afraid. <sup>7</sup>And there came
a cloud overshadowing them; and a voice came out of the cloud: This
is my beloved Son; hear ye him. <sup>8</sup>And suddenly, looking
around, they no longer saw any one, but Jesus only with
themselves.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And as they came down from the mountain,
he charged them that they should relate what they had seen to no
one, except when the Son of man shall have risen from the dead.
<sup>10</sup>And they kept the saying, questioning among
themselves, what is the rising from the dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And they asked him, saying: Why say the
scribes that Elijah must first come? <sup>12</sup>And he said to
them: Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. And how
is it written of the Son of man? That he must suffer many things,
and be set at naught. <sup>13</sup>But I say to you, that Elijah
also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it is
written of him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And coming to his disciples he saw a
great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them.
<sup>15</sup>And straightway all the multitude seeing him were
greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him. <sup>16</sup>And he
asked them: What question ye with them? <sup>17</sup>And one of the
multitude answered him: Teacher, I brought to thee my son, having a
dumb spirit. <sup>18</sup>And wherever it lays hold of him, it
tears him, and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he pines away.
And I spoke to thy disciples, that they should cast it out; and
they could not. <sup>19</sup>And he answering, says to them: O
faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall
I bear with you? Bring him to me. <sup>20</sup>And they brought him
to him. And seeing him, straightway the spirit rent him; and he
fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. <sup>21</sup>And he asked
his father: How long is it, since this came upon him? And he said:
From a child. <sup>22</sup>And ofttimes it cast him both into the
fire, and into the water, to destroy him. But if thou art able to
do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. <sup>23</sup>Jesus
said to him: If thou art able! All things are possible to the
believing. <sup>24</sup>And straightway the father of the child
cried out, and said: I believe; help thou my unbelief.
<sup>25</sup>And Jesus, seeing that a multitude came running
together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him: Dumb and deaf
spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter into him no more.
<sup>26</sup>And crying out, and rending him sorely, it came out of
him. And he became as one dead; so that many said: He is dead.
<sup>27</sup>But Jesus taking him by the hand, raised him, and he
stood up.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And when he had come into the house,
his disciples asked him privately: Why could not we cast it out?
<sup>29</sup>And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing,
except by prayer and fasting.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And going forth from thence, they
passed through Galilee and he would not that any one should know
it. <sup>31</sup>For he taught his disciples, and said to them: The
Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will
kill him and when he is killed, after three days he will rise
again. <sup>32</sup>But they understood not the saying, and were
afraid to ask him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And they came to Capernaum. And having
come into the house he inquired of them: Of what were ye reasoning
among yourselves by the way? <sup>34</sup>But they were silent; for
by the way they had disputed with one another, who was greatest.
<sup>35</sup>And sitting down, he called the twelve, and says to
them: If any one desires to be first, he shall be last of all, and
servant of all. <sup>36</sup>And taking a child, he placed it in
the midst of them; and folding it in his arms, he said to them:
<sup>37</sup>Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name,
receives me and whoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him
who sent me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And John answered him, saying: Teacher,
we saw one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us; and
we forbade him, because he follows not us. <sup>39</sup>But Jesus
said: Forbid him not; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in
my name, and can lightly speak evil of me. <sup>40</sup>For he that
is not against us is for us. <sup>41</sup>For whoever shall give
you a cup of water to drink in that name, that ye are Christ's,
verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward. <sup>42</sup>And
whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to
offend, it is better for him that an upper millstone were hanged
about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. <sup>43</sup>And if
thy hand cause thee to offend, cut it off. It is better for thee to
enter into life maimed, than having the two hands to go into hell,
into the fire that is unquenchable; <sup>44</sup>where their worm
dies not, and the fire is not quenched. <sup>45</sup>And if thy
foot cause thee to offend, cut it off. It is better for thee to
enter into life lame, than having the two feet to be cast into
hell, into the fire that is unquenchable; <sup>46</sup>where their
worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched. <sup>47</sup>And if
thine eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out. It is better for thee
to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes
to be cast into hell-fire; <sup>48</sup>where their worm dies not,
and the fire is not quenched. <sup>49</sup>For every one shall be
salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
<sup>50</sup>Salt is good; but if the salt become saltless,
wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at
peace with one another.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=
"sc">nd</span> rising up he goes thence into the borders of
Jud&aelig;a, and the further side of the Jordan. And again the
multitudes come together to him; and as he was wont, he again
taught them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And the Pharisees came to him, and asked
him, if it is lawful for a man to put away a wife, tempting him.
<sup>3</sup>And he answering said to them: What did Moses command
you? <sup>4</sup>And they said: Moses permitted to write a bill of
divorcement, and to put her away. <sup>5</sup>And Jesus answering
said to them: For your hardness of heart he wrote you this command.
<sup>6</sup>But from the beginning of the creation, God made them
male and female. <sup>7</sup><span class="ot">For this cause shall
a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;
and the two shall be one flesh.</span> <sup>8</sup>So that they are
no longer two, but one flesh. <sup>9</sup>What therefore God joined
together, let not man put asunder.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And in the house his disciples asked
him again concerning this. <sup>11</sup>And he says to them:
Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, commits
adultery against her. <sup>12</sup>And if a woman shall put away
her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And they brought little children to
him, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked those who
brought them. <sup>14</sup>But Jesus seeing it, was much
displeased, and said to them: Suffer the little children to come to
me; forbid them not, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.
<sup>15</sup>Verily I say to you, whoever shall not receive the
kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter therein.
<sup>16</sup>And he folded them in his arms, put his hands on them,
and blessed them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And as he was going forth into the way,
there came one running, and kneeling to him, and asked him: Good
Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
<sup>18</sup>And Jesus said to him: Why callest thou me good? There
is none good but one, God. <sup>19</sup>Thou knowest the
commandments: <span class="ot">Do not commit adultery, Do not kill,
Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy
father and mother.</span> <sup>20</sup>And he answering said to
him: Teacher, all these I kept from my youth. <sup>21</sup>And
Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him: One thing thou
lackest; go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and
thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross,
and follow me. <sup>22</sup>And he became sad at that saying, and
went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And looking around, Jesus says to his
disciples: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the
kingdom of God! <sup>24</sup>And the disciples were astonished at
his words. But Jesus answering again says to them: Children, how
hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom
of God! <sup>25</sup>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
<sup>26</sup>And they were exceedingly amazed, saying among
themselves: Who then can be saved? <sup>27</sup>And Jesus, looking
on them, says: With men it is impossible, but not with God; for
with God all things are possible.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Peter began to say to him: Lo, we
forsook all, and followed thee. <sup>29</sup>And Jesus answering
said: Verily I say to you, there is no one who forsook house, or
brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,
or lands, for the sake of me and of the glad tidings,
<sup>30</sup>but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time,
houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come eternal life.
<sup>31</sup>But many first will be last, and the last first.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And they were in the way going up to
Jerusalem. And Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed,
and as they followed they were afraid. And again he took with him
the twelve, and began to say to them what things should happen to
him: <sup>33</sup>Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son
of man will be delivered up to the chief priests, and to the
scribes; and they will condemn him to death and will deliver him up
to the Gentiles; <sup>34</sup>and they will mock him, and scourge
him, and spit upon him, and will kill him; and after three days he
will rise again.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And James and John, the sons of
Zebedee, come to him saying: Teacher, we desire that thou shouldst
do for us whatever we shall ask. <sup>36</sup>And he said to them:
What do ye desire that I should do for you? <sup>37</sup>They said
to him: Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the
other on the left, in thy glory. <sup>38</sup>And Jesus said to
them: Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I
drink, or to endure the immersion which I endure? <sup>39</sup>And
they said to him: We are able. And Jesus said to them: Ye shall
indeed drink the cup that I drink, and endure the immersion which I
endure. <sup>40</sup>But to sit on my right hand, or on the left,
is not mine to give, but is for them for whom it has been
prepared.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And the ten, hearing it, began to be
much displeased with James and John. <sup>42</sup>And Jesus,
calling them to him, says to them: Ye know that they who are
accounted to rule<sup><a href="#r411042" id="f411042" title=
"see footnote" name="f411042">42</a></sup> over the Gentiles
exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise
authority over them. <sup>43</sup>But it is not so among you. But
whoever would become great among you, shall be your minister;
<sup>44</sup>and whoever would become chiefest of you, shall be
servant of all. <sup>45</sup>For even the Son of man came not to be
ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
many.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>And they come to Jericho. And as he was
going forth from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude,
the son of Tim&aelig;us, Bartim&aelig;us, a blind beggar, was
sitting by the way-side. <sup>47</sup>And hearing that it is Jesus
the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say: Son of David, Jesus,
have mercy on me. <sup>48</sup>And many rebuked him, that he should
hold his peace. But he cried all the more: Son of David, have mercy
on me. <sup>49</sup>And Jesus stood still, and said: Call him. And
they call the blind man, saying to him: Be of good cheer; rise, he
calls thee. <sup>50</sup>And he, casting away his garment, leaped
up, and came to Jesus. <sup>51</sup>And Jesus answering said to
him: What wilt thou that I should do to thee? The blind man said to
him: Lord, that I may receive sight. <sup>52</sup>And Jesus said to
him: Go thy way; thy faith has made thee whole. And immediately he
received sight, and followed him in the way.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> when they
come near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany at the mount of
the Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples, <sup>2</sup>and
says to them: Go into the village over against you; and
immediately, on entering into it, ye will find a colt tied, whereon
no man has sat; loose and bring him. <sup>3</sup>And if any one say
to you: Why do ye this? say: The Lord has need of him; and
straightway he will send him hither. <sup>4</sup>And they departed,
and found a colt tied by the door without, on the street; and they
loose him. <sup>5</sup>And some of those standing there, said to
them: What do ye, loosing the colt? <sup>6</sup>And they said to
them as Jesus commanded; and they let them go. <sup>7</sup>And they
bring the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat
upon him. <sup>8</sup>And many spread their garments in the way,
and others branches, cutting them from the fields<sup><a href=
"#r411108" id="f411108" title="see footnote" name=

they that followed, cried: Hosanna! blessed is he that comes in the
name of the Lord; <sup>10</sup>blessed is the coming kingdom of our
father David; Hosanna in the highest! <sup>11</sup>And he entered
into Jerusalem, and into the temple; and having looked around on
all things, the evening being now come, he went out to Bethany with
the twelve.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And on the morrow, when they had come
out from Bethany, he was hungry. <sup>13</sup>And seeing a fig-tree
afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything
thereon. And coming to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was
not the season of figs. <sup>14</sup>And answering he said to it:
Let no one eat fruit from thee, henceforth forever. And his
disciples heard it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And they come into Jerusalem. And
entering into the temple, he began to cast out those who sold and
bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money
changers, and the seats of those who sold doves; <sup>16</sup>and
suffered not that any one should carry a vessel through the temple.
<sup>17</sup>And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written:
<span class="ot">My house shall be called a house of prayer for all
the nations? But ye have made it a den of robbers.</span>
<sup>18</sup>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it. And
they sought how they might destroy him; for they feared him, for
all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. <sup>19</sup>And
when it became late, he went forth out of the city.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And passing by in the morning, they saw
the fig-tree dried up from the roots. <sup>21</sup>And Peter,
calling to remembrance, says to him: Master, behold, the fig-tree
which thou didst curse is withered away. <sup>22</sup>And Jesus
answering says to them: Have faith in God. <sup>23</sup>Verily I
say to you, that whoever shall say to this mountain: Be thou taken
up and cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but
shall believe that what he says comes to pass, he shall have it.
<sup>24</sup>Therefore I say to you: All things whatever ye ask,
when ye pray, believe that ye received, and ye shall have them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And when ye stand praying, forgive, if
ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in
heaven may forgive you your trespasses. <sup>26</sup>But if ye do
not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your
trespasses<sup><a href="#r411126" id="f411126" title="see footnote"

<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And they come again into Jerusalem. And
as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief
priests, and the scribes, and the elders. <sup>28</sup>And they
said to him: By what authority doest thou these things? And who
gave thee this authority, to do these things? <sup>29</sup>And
Jesus answering said to them: I also will ask you one thing; and
answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
<sup>30</sup>John's immersion, was it from heaven, or from men?
Answer me. <sup>31</sup>And they reasoned among themselves, saying:
<sup>32</sup>If we say, from heaven; he will say, why then did ye
not believe him? But shall we say from men? They feared the people;
for all held that John was verily a prophet. <sup>33</sup>And
answering they say to Jesus: We do not know. And Jesus says to
them: Neither do I say to you, by what authority I do these
things.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a
hedge about it, and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it
out to husbandmen, and went abroad. <sup>2</sup>And at the season
he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the
husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. <sup>3</sup>And they took
him and beat him, and sent him away empty. <sup>4</sup>And again he
sent to them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and
wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
<sup>5</sup>And he sent another; and him they killed, and many
others; beating some, and killing some. <sup>6</sup>Having yet
therefore one beloved son, he sent him also to them last, saying:
They will reverence my son. <sup>7</sup>But those husbandmen said
among themselves: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the
inheritance will be ours. <sup>8</sup>And they took, and killed
him, and cast him out of the vineyard. <sup>9</sup>What therefore
will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the
husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. <sup>10</sup>And
have ye not read this scripture:</p>
<p class="pp1">The stone which the builders disallowed,</p>
<p class="pp1">The same is become the head of the corner;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>11</sup>This is from the Lord, and is wonderful
in our eyes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And they sought to lay hold of him, but
feared the people; for they knew that he spoke the parable against
them; and they left him, and went away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And they send to him some of the
Pharisees and of the Herodians, to entrap him with a word.
<sup>14</sup>And they come and say to him: Teacher, we know that
thou art true, and carest for no one; for thou regardest not the
person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful
to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, or not? <sup>15</sup>Shall we give,
or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to
them: Why tempt ye me? Bring me a den&aacute;ry<sup><a href=
"#r411215" id="f411215" title="see footnote" name=
"f411215">15</a></sup>, that I may see it. <sup>16</sup>And they
brought it. And he says to them: Whose is this image, and the
inscription? And they said to him: C&aelig;sar's. <sup>17</sup>And
Jesus answering said to them: Render to C&aelig;sar the things that
are C&aelig;sar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they
marveled at him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And there come to him Sadducees, who
say there is no resurrection. And they asked him, saying:
<sup>19</sup>Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if one's brother die,
and leave a wife behind, and leave no children, his brother should
take the wife, and raise up seed to his brother. <sup>20</sup>There
were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying left no
seed. <sup>21</sup>And the second took her, and died, and he also
left no seed; and the third likewise. <sup>22</sup>And the seven
took her, and left no seed. Last of all the woman died also.
<sup>23</sup>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise
again, of which of them shall she be wife? For the seven had her
for a wife. <sup>24</sup>Jesus answering said to them: Do ye not
therefore err, because ye know not the Scriptures, nor the power of
God? <sup>25</sup>For when they shall rise from the dead, they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels who are
in heaven. <sup>26</sup>And concerning the dead, that they rise,
have ye not read in the book of Moses, at The Bush, how God spoke
to him, saying: <span class="ot">I am the God of Abraham, and the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span> <sup>27</sup>He is not
God of the dead, but of the living. Ye greatly err.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And one of the scribes came to him, and
having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he
answered them well, asked him: Which commandment is first of all?
<sup>29</sup>And Jesus answered him: First is, <span class=
"ot">Hear, O Israel; the Lord is our God, the Lord is one;</span>
<sup>30</sup><span class="ot">and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,
and with all thy strength.</span> This is the first commandment.
<sup>31</sup>Second is this: <span class="ot">Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.</span> There is no other commandment greater
than these. <sup>32</sup>And the scribe said to him: Well, Teacher;
thou saidst truly that he is one, and there is no other beside him;
<sup>33</sup>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the
understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength,
and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all the
whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices. <sup>34</sup>And Jesus,
seeing that he answered intelligently, said to him: Thou art not
far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared any longer to
question him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And Jesus answering said, while
teaching in the temple: How say the scribes that the Christ is son
of David? <sup>36</sup>For David himself said, in the Holy
Spirit:</p>
<p class="pp4">The LORD said to my Lord,</p>
<p class="pp4">Sit on my right hand,</p>
<p class="pp4">Till I put thy enemies under thy feet.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>37</sup>David himself calls him Lord; and
whence is he his son? And the great multitude heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And he said to them in his teaching:
Beware of the scribes, who love to go about in long robes, and love
greetings in the markets, <sup>39</sup>and the first seats in the
synagogues, and the first places at the feasts; <sup>40</sup>who
devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these
shall receive greater condemnation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And sitting over against the treasury,
he beheld how the people cast money into the treasury; and many
that were rich cast in much. <sup>42</sup>And one poor widow came,
and cast in two mites, which are a farthing. <sup>43</sup>And
calling to him his disciples, he said to them: Verily I say to you,
that this poor widow cast in more than all who are casting into the
treasury. <sup>44</sup>For all cast in out of their abundance; but
she, out of her want, cast in all that she had, her whole
living.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> as he
went out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him: Teacher,
see what manner of stones, and what manner of buildings!
<sup>2</sup>And Jesus said to him: Seest thou these great
buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another, that
shall not be thrown down.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And as he was sitting on the mount of
the Olives, over against the temple, Peter and James and John and
Andrew asked him privately: <sup>4</sup>Tell us, when will these
things be? And what is the sign when all these things are about to
be accomplished.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And Jesus began to say to them: Take
heed lest any one lead you astray. <sup>6</sup>For many will come
in my name, saying: I am he; and will lead many astray.
<sup>7</sup>And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be
not troubled, for it must come to pass; but not yet is the end.
<sup>8</sup>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom
against kingdom; and there will be earthquakes in divers places,
and there will be famines and commotions; these are the beginning
of sorrows.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>But do ye take heed to yourselves; for
they will deliver you up to councils, and in the synagogues ye will
be beaten; and ye will be brought before governors and kings for my
sake for a testimony to them. <sup>10</sup>And the good news must
first be preached among all the nations.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>But when they lead you away to deliver
you up, take not thought beforehand what ye shall speak nor
premeditate; but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that
speak; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
<sup>12</sup>And the brother will deliver up the brother to death,
and the father the child; and children will rise up against
parents, and will put them to death. <sup>13</sup>And ye will be
hated by all for my name's sake; but he that has endured unto the
end, the same shall be saved.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>But when ye see the abomination of
desolation standing where it ought not, (let him that reads, mark!)
then let those in Jud&aelig;a flee to the mountains.
<sup>15</sup>And he that is upon the house, let him not go down
into the house, nor enter in to take anything out of his house.
<sup>16</sup>And he that is in the field, let him not turn back to
take his garment.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>But woe to those who are with child,
and to those who give suck in those days! <sup>18</sup>And pray
that it be not in the winter. <sup>19</sup>For in those days will
be affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the
creation which God created until now, neither shall be.
<sup>20</sup>And if the Lord had not shortened those days, no flesh
would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen, whom he
chose, he shortened the days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And then if any one say to you: Lo,
here is the Christ, or Lo, there, believe not. <sup>22</sup>For
false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs
and wonders, so as to lead, if possible, even the chosen astray.
<sup>23</sup>But do ye take heed; I have foretold you all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>But in those days, after that
affliction, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give
her light; <sup>25</sup>and the stars shall fall from heaven, and
the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. <sup>26</sup>And
then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds, with great
power and glory. <sup>27</sup>And then will he send forth the
angels, and gather together his chosen from the four winds, from
the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of
heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And learn the parable from the
fig-tree. When its branch is already become tender, and puts forth
leaves, ye know that summer is near. <sup>29</sup>So also ye, when
ye see these things come to pass, know that it is near, at the
doors. <sup>30</sup>Verily I say to you, that this generation shall
not pass, till all these things are done. <sup>31</sup>Heaven and
earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>But of that day or hour no one knows,
not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.
<sup>33</sup>Take heed, watch; for ye know not when the time is.
<sup>34</sup>As a man who is abroad, having left his house, and
given authority to his servants, to each one his work, also
commanded the porter that he should watch; <sup>35</sup>watch
therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house comes, at
evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning;
<sup>36</sup>lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
<sup>37</sup>And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

after, was the passover, and the feast of unleavened bread; and the
chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by
craft, and put him to death. <sup>2</sup>For they said: Not at the
feast, lest there shall be a tumult of the people.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And he being in Bethany, in the house of
Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, there came a woman
having an alabaster box of ointment of pure spikenard, very
precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.
<sup>4</sup>And there were some that were much displeased among
themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?
<sup>5</sup>For this ointment could have been sold for more than
three hundred den&aacute;ries, and given to the poor. And they
murmured at her. <sup>6</sup>And Jesus said: Let her alone; why do
ye trouble her? She wrought a good work on me. <sup>7</sup>For the
poor ye have always with you, and when ye will ye can do good to
them; but me ye have not always. <sup>8</sup>She did what she
could; she beforehand anointed my body for the preparation for
burial. <sup>9</sup>Verily I say to you, wherever the good news
shall be preached in the whole world, this also that she did shall
be told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve,
went to the chief priests, to deliver him up to them.
<sup>11</sup>And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised
to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver
him up.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And on the first day of the feast of
unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples say
to him: Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest
eat the passover? <sup>13</sup>And he sends forth two of his
disciples, and says to them: Go into the city, and there will meet
you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him. <sup>14</sup>And
where he shall go in, say to the master of the house: The Teacher
says, Where is the guest-chamber, in which I may eat the passover
with my disciples? <sup>15</sup>And he will show you a large upper
room furnished, ready; there prepare for us. <sup>16</sup>And his
disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he said
to them; and they made ready the passover.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And at evening he comes with the
twelve. <sup>18</sup>And as they were reclining at table, and
eating, Jesus said: Verily I say to you, that one of you will
betray me, one that eats with me! <sup>19</sup>And they began to be
sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I? And another said:
Is it I? <sup>20</sup>And he answering said to them: It is one of
the twelve, one that dips with me into the dish. <sup>21</sup>The
Son of man indeed goes, as it is written of him; but woe to that
man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for him
if that man had not been born.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And as they were eating, Jesus, taking
a loaf, blessed, and broke, and gave it to them, and said: Take it;
this is my body. <sup>23</sup>And taking the cup, he gave thanks,
and gave it to them; and they all drank of it. <sup>24</sup>And he
said to them: This is my blood of the covenant, which is shed for
many. <sup>25</sup>Verily I say to you, I will drink no more of the
fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the
kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And having sung, they went out into the
mount of the Olives. <sup>27</sup>And Jesus says to them: All ye
will be offended; because it is written: <span class="ot">I will
smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</span>
<sup>28</sup>But after I am risen, I will go before you into
Galilee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And Peter said to him: Though all shall
be offended, yet will not I. <sup>30</sup>And Jesus says to him:
Verily I say to thee, that thou this day, in this night, before a
cock crows twice, wilt thrice deny me. <sup>31</sup>But he said the
more vehemently: If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee.
Likewise also said they all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And they come to a place which was
named Gethsemane. And he says to his disciples: Sit ye here, while
I shall pray. <sup>33</sup>And he takes with him Peter and James
and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be troubled.
<sup>34</sup>And he says to them: My soul is exceedingly sorrowful,
unto death; tarry here, and watch. <sup>35</sup>And going forward a
little, he fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were
possible, the hour might pass from him. <sup>36</sup>And he said:
Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; take away this cup
from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>And he comes, and finds them sleeping.
And he says to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Couldest thou not watch
one hour? <sup>38</sup>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And again he went away and prayed,
saying the same words. <sup>40</sup>And returning, he found them
again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what
to answer him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And he comes the third time, and says
to them: Do ye sleep the remaining time, and take your
rest<sup><a href="#r411441" id="f411441" title="see footnote" name=
"f411441">41</a></sup>? It is enough, the hour is come; behold, the
Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
<sup>42</sup>Rise, let us go; behold, he that betrays me is at
hand.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>And immediately, while he was yet
speaking, comes Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude
with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and
the elders. <sup>44</sup>And his betrayer had given them a signal,
saying: Whom I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold of him, and lead
him away securely. <sup>45</sup>And coming, he goes straightway to
him, and says: Master, Master; and kissed him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>And they laid their hands on him, and
held him fast. <sup>47</sup>And one of those standing by drew his
sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and took off his
ear. <sup>48</sup>And Jesus answering said to them: Came ye out, as
against a robber, with swords and staves to take me? <sup>49</sup>I
was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye did not lay hold
of me; but that the Scriptures might be fulfilled! <sup>50</sup>And
all forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>51</sup>And there followed him a certain young
man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young
men lay hold of him. <sup>52</sup>And leaving behind the linen
cloth, he fled from them naked.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>53</sup>And they led Jesus away to the high
priest; and with him assembled all the chief priests and the elders
and the scribes. <sup>54</sup>And Peter followed him afar off, even
into the court of the high priest, and was sitting with the
officers, and warming himself at the fire.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>55</sup>And the chief priests and all the
council sought for testimony against Jesus, in order to put him to
death; and they found none. <sup>56</sup>For many bore false
witness against him; but their testimonies agreed not together.
<sup>57</sup>And certain ones rose up, and bore false witness
against him, saying: <sup>58</sup>We heard him say, I will destroy
this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build
another made without hands. <sup>59</sup>And not even so did their
testimony agree.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>60</sup>And the high priest stood up in the
midst, and asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing? What do
these witness against thee? <sup>61</sup>But he was silent, and
answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him:
Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? <sup>62</sup>And Jesus
said: I am; and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right
hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
<sup>63</sup>And the high priest, rending his clothes, says: What
further need have we of witnesses? <sup>64</sup>Ye heard the
blasphemy. What think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty
of death.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>65</sup>And some began to spit on him, and to
cover his face and buffet him, and say to him: Prophesy. And the
officers, with blows, took him in charge.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>66</sup>And Peter being below in the court,
there comes one of the maid-servants of the high priest;
<sup>67</sup>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him,
and said: Thou also wast with Jesus the Nazarene. <sup>68</sup>But
he denied, saying: I do not know, nor do I understand what thou
sayest. And he went out into the fore-court; and a cock crowed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>69</sup>And the maid-servant, seeing him, began
again to say to those standing by: This is one of them.
<sup>70</sup>And he again denied it.</p>
<p class="pin">And a little after, they that stood by said again to
Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galil&aelig;an.
<sup>71</sup>But he began to invoke curses, and to swear: I do not
know this man of whom ye speak. <sup>72</sup>And a cock crowed a
second time. And Peter remembered the word, how Jesus said to him:
Before a cock crows twice, thou wilt thrice deny me. And as he
thought thereon, he wept.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

straightway, in the morning, the chief priests with the elders and
scribes and the whole council, having held a consultation, bound
Jesus and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
<sup>2</sup>And Pilate asked him: Art thou the King of the Jews?
And he answering said to him: Thou sayest it. <sup>3</sup>And the
chief priests accused him of many things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And Pilate asked him again, saying:
Answerest thou nothing? Behold what things they testify against
thee. <sup>5</sup>But Jesus no longer made any answer; so that
Pilate marveled.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And at the feast he released to them one
prisoner, whomsoever they asked. <sup>7</sup>And there was the one
called Barabbas, bound with his companions in sedition, who in the
sedition had committed murder. <sup>8</sup>And coming up, the
multitude began to make request, according as he had always done
for them. <sup>9</sup>And Pilate answered them, saying: Will ye
that I release to you the King of the Jews? <sup>10</sup>For he
knew that through envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
<sup>11</sup>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that
he should rather release to them Barabbas. <sup>12</sup>And Pilate
answering, said again to them: What will ye then that I shall do to
him whom ye call the King of the Jews? <sup>13</sup>And they cried
again: Crucify him. <sup>14</sup>And Pilate said to them: What evil
then has he done? And they cried the more exceedingly: Crucify
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the
multitude, released to them Barabbas; and he delivered up Jesus,
after scourging him, to be crucified. <sup>16</sup>And the soldiers
led him away into the court, which is Pr&aelig;torium; and they
call together the whole band. <sup>17</sup>And they clothe him with
purple, and having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
<sup>18</sup>And they began to salute him: Hail, King of the Jews!
<sup>19</sup>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and spit
upon him, and kneeling down, did homage to him. <sup>20</sup>And
when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and
put on him his own garments.</p>
<p class="pin">And they lead him out to crucify him.
<sup>21</sup>And they compel one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was passing
by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to
bear his cross. <sup>22</sup>And they bring him to the place
Golgotha, which is interpreted, Place of a skull. <sup>23</sup>And
they gave him wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.
<sup>24</sup>And having crucified him, they divide his garments,
casting lots upon them, what any one should take. <sup>25</sup>And
it was the third hour; and they crucified him. <sup>26</sup>And the
inscription of the accusation against him was written over: THE
KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And with him they crucify two robbers;
one on his right hand, and one on his left. <sup>28</sup>And the
scripture was fulfilled, which says: <span class="ot">And he was
reckoned with transgressors.</span> <sup>29</sup>And they that
passed by railed at him, wagging their heads, and saying: Aha, thou
that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days;
<sup>30</sup>save thyself, and come down from the cross.
<sup>31</sup>Likewise also the chief priests, mocking one with
another, together with the scribes, said: Others he saved, himself
he can not save. <sup>32</sup>Let the Christ, the King of Israel,
come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they
that were crucified with him reproached him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And when the sixth hour was come, there
was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
<sup>34</sup>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamasabachthani? Which is interpreted: My God,
my God, why didst thou forsake me? <sup>35</sup>And some of those
standing by, hearing it, said: Behold, he calls Elijah.
<sup>36</sup>And one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and put
it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying: Let alone; let us see
whether Elijah comes to take him down. <sup>37</sup>And Jesus,
uttering a loud cry, expired. <sup>38</sup>And the vail of the
temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom.
<sup>39</sup>And the centurion who was standing near, over against
him, seeing that he so cried out and expired, said: Truly this man

<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>And there were also women looking on
afar off; among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome;
<sup>41</sup>who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
ministered to him; and many other women who came up with him to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>42</sup>And evening having now come, since it
was the preparation (which is the day before the
sabbath<sup><a href="#r411542" id="f411542" title="see footnote"

Arimath&aelig;a, an honorable counselor, who also was himself
waiting for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate,
and asked for the body of Jesus. <sup>44</sup>And Pilate marveled,
if he were already dead; and calling to him the centurion, he asked
him if he had been long dead. <sup>45</sup>And having learned it
from the centurion, he gave the dead body to Joseph.
<sup>46</sup>And having bought fine linen, and taken him down, he
wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was
hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the
sepulchre. <sup>47</sup>And Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother
of Joses, beheld where he was laid.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

sabbath being past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of
James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And very early, on the first day of the
week, they come to the sepulchre, when the sun was risen.
<sup>3</sup>And they said to one another: Who will roll away the
stone for us, out of the door of the sepulchre? <sup>4</sup>And
looking up, they see that the stone has been rolled away. For it
was very great. <sup>5</sup>And entering into the sepulchre, they
saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe;
and they were affrighted. <sup>6</sup>And he says to them: Be not
affrighted. Ye are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified.
He is risen; he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him.
<sup>7</sup>But go, say to his disciples, and to Peter, that he
goes before you into Galilee. There shall ye see him, as he said to
you. <sup>8</sup>And they went out, and fled from the sepulchre;
for trembling and astonishment seized them. And they said nothing
to any one; for they were afraid.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And having risen early, on the first day
of the week, he appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, from whom he
had cast out seven demons. <sup>10</sup>She went and reported it to
those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
<sup>11</sup>And they, hearing that he is alive, and was seen by
her, believed not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>After that he appeared in another form
to two of them, as they walked, going into the country.
<sup>13</sup>They also went and reported it to the rest; nor did
they believe them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Afterward he appeared to the eleven
themselves as they reclined at table, and upbraided their unbelief
and hardness of heart, because they believed not those who saw him
after he was risen. <sup>15</sup>And he said to them: Go into all
the world, and preach the good news to every creature.
<sup>16</sup>He that believes and is immersed shall be saved; but
he that believes not shall be condemned. <sup>17</sup>And these
signs shall accompany those who have believed; in my name they
shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
<sup>18</sup>they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any
deadly thing, it shall not hurt them, they shall lay hands on the
sick, and they shall recover.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>The Lord therefore, after he had spoken
to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down on the right hand
of God; <sup>20</sup>and they went forth, and preached everywhere,
the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs
that followed.</p>

concerning those things<sup><a href="#r420104" id="f420104" title=
"see footnote" name="f420104">4</a></sup> wherein thou wast
instructed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>There was in the days of Herod, the king
of Jud&aelig;a, a certain priest, Zachariah by name, of the course
of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name
was Elisabeth. <sup>6</sup>And they were both righteous before God,
walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord
blameless. <sup>7</sup>And they had no child, because Elisabeth was
barren; and they both were now far advanced in years.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And it came to pass, that while he
executed the priest's office before God, in the order of his
course, <sup>9</sup>it fell to his lot, according to the custom of
the priest's office, to burn incense, going into the temple of the
Lord. <sup>10</sup>And the whole multitude of the people were
praying without, at the hour of incense. <sup>11</sup>And there
appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of
the altar of incense. <sup>12</sup>And Zachariah seeing him was
troubled, and fear fell upon him. <sup>13</sup>But the angel said
to him: Fear not, Zachariah; for thy prayer was heard, and thy wife
Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
<sup>14</sup>And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall
rejoice at his birth. <sup>15</sup>For he shall be great before the
Lord; and he shall not drink wine nor strong drink; and he shall be
filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.
<sup>16</sup>And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to the
Lord their God. <sup>17</sup>And he shall go before him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to
the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to
make ready a prepared people for the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And Zachariah said to the angel:
Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far
advanced in years. <sup>19</sup>And the angel answering said to
him: I am Gabriel, that stands in the presence of God; and I was
sent to speak to thee, and to bring thee these glad tidings.
<sup>20</sup>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to
speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because
thou didst not believe thy words, which shall be fulfilled in their
season.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And the people were waiting for
Zachariah; and they were wondering at his long tarrying in the
temple. <sup>22</sup>And when he came out he was not able to speak
to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the
temple; and he was making signs to them, and remained
speechless.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And it came to pass, when the days of
his ministration were completed, that he departed to his own
house.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And after those days his wife Elisabeth
conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying:
<sup>25</sup>Thus has the Lord dealt with me, in the days wherein
he looked on me to take away my reproach among men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And in the sixth month the angel
Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
<sup>27</sup>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph,
of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
<sup>28</sup>And the angel coming in to her, said: Hail, highly
favored! The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women.
<sup>29</sup>And she was troubled at the saying; and was
considering what manner of salutation this might be.
<sup>30</sup>And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary; for thou
didst find favor with God. <sup>31</sup>And, behold, thou shalt
conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his
name Jesus. <sup>32</sup>He shall be great, and shall be called Son
of the Highest; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of
David his father; <sup>33</sup>and he shall reign over the house of
Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>Then said Mary to the angel: How shall
this be, seeing that I know not a man? <sup>35</sup>And the angel
answering said to her: The Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the
power of the Highest will overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy
One that is born shall be called the Son of God. <sup>36</sup>And,
behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in
her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who is called
barren. <sup>37</sup>For with God nothing shall be<sup><a href=

<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of
the Lord; let it be to me according to thy word. And the angel
departed from her.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And Mary arose in those days, and went
into the hill-country with haste, into a city of Judah;
<sup>40</sup>and entered into the house of Zachariah, and saluted
Elisabeth. <sup>41</sup>And it came to pass, as Elisabeth heard the
salutation of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth
was filled with the Holy Spirit. <sup>42</sup>And she spoke out
with a loud voice and said: Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb. <sup>43</sup>And whence is this
to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
<sup>44</sup>For, behold, as the voice of thy salutation came into
my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. <sup>45</sup>And happy
is she, who believed that there shall be<sup><a href="#r420145" id=
"f420145" title="see footnote" name="f420145">45</a></sup> a
fulfillment of the things told her from the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>And Mary said: My soul magnifies the
Lord; <sup>47</sup>and my spirit rejoiced in God my Savior.
<sup>48</sup>Because he looked upon the low estate of his handmaid;
for, behold, henceforth all generations will call me happy.
<sup>49</sup>Because the Mighty One did great things for me; and
holy is his name. <sup>50</sup>And his mercy is from generation to
generation, to those who fear him. <sup>51</sup>He wrought might
with his arm; he scattered the proud in the imagination of their
hearts. <sup>52</sup>He cast down princes from thrones, and exalted
those of low degree. <sup>53</sup>The hungry he filled with good,
and the rich he sent empty away. <sup>54</sup>He helped Israel, his
servant; to remember mercy, <sup>55</sup>as he spoke to our
fathers, for Abraham and for his seed forever.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>56</sup>And Mary abode with her about three
months, and returned to her own house.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>57</sup>Now Elisabeth's full time came that she
should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. <sup>58</sup>And
her neighbors and her kindred heard that the Lord showed great
mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>59</sup>And it came to pass, that on the eighth
day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him
Zachariah, after the name of his father. <sup>60</sup>And his
mother answered and said: Nay; but he shall be called John.
<sup>61</sup>And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred
that is called by this name. <sup>62</sup>And they made signs to
his father, how he would have him called. <sup>63</sup>And asking
for a writing-tablet, he wrote, saying: His name is John. And they
all wondered. <sup>64</sup>And his mouth was opened immediately,
and his tongue was loosed; and he spoke, blessing God.
<sup>65</sup>And fear came on all that dwelt around them. And all
these things<sup><a href="#r420165" id="f420165" title=
"see footnote" name="f420165">65</a></sup> were told abroad in all
the hill-country of Jud&aelig;a. <sup>66</sup>And all who heard
laid them up in their hearts, saying: What then will this child be!
And the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>67</sup>And Zachariah his father was filled
with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying: <sup>68</sup>Blessed
be the Lord, the God of Israel, that he visited and wrought
redemption for his people; <sup>69</sup>and raised up a horn of
salvation for us, in the house of David his servant,
<sup>70</sup>(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets of
old,) <sup>71</sup>salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of
all that hate us; <sup>72</sup>to show mercy to our fathers, and to
remember his holy covenant; <sup>73</sup>the oath which he swore to
Abraham our father, <sup>74</sup>to grant to us, that without fear,
being rescued from the hand of our enemies, we should serve him,
<sup>75</sup>in holiness and righteousness before him all our
days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>76</sup>And also thou, O child, shalt be called
Prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of the
Lord, to prepare his ways, <sup>77</sup>in order to give knowledge
of salvation to his people in remission of their sins;
<sup>78</sup>through the tender mercies of our God, whereby the
dayspring from on high visited us, <sup>79</sup>to give light to
those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, in order to
guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>80</sup>And the child grew, and became strong
in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation
to Israel.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

pass in those days, that there went out a decree from C&aelig;sar
Augustus, that all the world should be registered. <sup>2</sup>This
registering was the first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.
<sup>3</sup>And all went to be registered, each one to his own
city. <sup>4</sup>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the
city of Nazareth, into Jud&aelig;a, to the city of David which is
called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and family of David),
<sup>5</sup>to be registered with Mary his betrothed wife, who was
with child. <sup>6</sup>And so it was, that, while they were there,
the days were completed that she should bring forth.
<sup>7</sup>And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped
him in swathing bands, and laid him in a manger; because there was
no room for them in the inn.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And there were in the same country
shepherds abiding in the field, and keeping watch over their flock
by night. <sup>9</sup>And, behold, an angel of the Lord came upon
them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were
sore afraid. <sup>10</sup>And the angel said to them: Fear not;
for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be
to all the people. <sup>11</sup>For to you is born this day in the
city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. <sup>12</sup>And
this shall be to you the sign: Ye will find a babe wrapped in
swathing bands, lying in a manger. <sup>13</sup>And suddenly there
was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God
and saying: <sup>14</sup>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will among men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And it came to pass, when the angels
were gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said one
to another: Let us go now unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that
is come to pass, which the Lord made known to us. <sup>16</sup>And
they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe
lying in the manger. <sup>17</sup>And having seen it, they made
known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.
<sup>18</sup>And all that heard wondered at the things which were
told them by the shepherds. <sup>19</sup>And Mary kept all these
things<sup><a href="#r420219" id="f420219" title="see footnote"
name="f420219">19</a></sup>, pondering them in her heart.
<sup>20</sup>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising
God for all that they heard and saw, as it was told to them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And when eight days were completed for
circumcising him, his name was called Jesus; the name given by the
angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And when the days of their
purification, according to the law of Moses, were completed, they
brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,
<sup>23</sup>(as it is written in the law of the Lord: <span class=
"ot">Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the
Lord</span>;) <sup>24</sup>and to offer a sacrifice according to
what is said in the law of the Lord: <span class="ot">A pair of
turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And, behold, there was a man in
Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was just and devout,
waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon
him, <sup>26</sup>And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit,
that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the
Lord. <sup>27</sup>And he came by the Spirit into the temple; and
when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after
the custom of the law, <sup>28</sup>then he took him into his arms,
and blessed God, and said: <sup>29</sup>Now, Lord, thou lettest thy
servant depart in peace, according to thy word;
<sup>30</sup>because my eyes saw thy salvation, <sup>31</sup>which
thou preparedst before the face of all the peoples, <sup>32</sup>a
light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
Israel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And his father and mother wondered at
the things spoken of him. <sup>34</sup>And Simeon blessed them, and
said to Mary his mother: Behold, this child is set for the fall and
rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that shall be spoken
against, <sup>35</sup>(and a sword shall pierce through thine own
soul also), that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And there was Anna, a prophetess,
daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of great age,
and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;
<sup>37</sup>and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years,
who departed not from the temple, serving day and night with
fastings and prayers. <sup>38</sup>And she, coming up at that very
time, likewise gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all
that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And when they had performed all things
according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to
their own city Nazareth. <sup>40</sup>And the child grew, and
became strong, being filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was
upon him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And his parents went to Jerusalem every
year at the feast of the passover. <sup>42</sup>And when he was
twelve years old, they having gone up according to the custom of
the feast, <sup>43</sup>and completed the days, as they returned,
Jesus the child remained behind in Jerusalem. And his parents knew
it not, <sup>44</sup>but supposing that he was in the company, went
a day's journey, and sought him among their kindred and
acquaintance; <sup>45</sup>and not finding him, they returned to
Jerusalem, seeking him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>And it came to pass, that after three
days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the
teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
<sup>47</sup>And all that heard him, were astonished at his
understanding and answers. <sup>48</sup>And seeing him they were
amazed. And his mother said to him: Child, why didst thou thus deal
with us? Behold, thy father and I sought thee, sorrowing.
<sup>49</sup>And he said to them: How is it that ye sought me? Did
ye not know, that I must be in my Father's house<sup><a href=

saying which he spoke to them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>51</sup>And he went down with them, and came to
Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these
sayings in her heart.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>52</sup>And Jesus increased in wisdom and
stature, and in favor with God and men.</p>

fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius C&aelig;sar, when Pontius
Pilate was governor of Jud&aelig;a, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee,
and his brother Philip tetrarch, of Iturea and of the region of
Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, <sup>2</sup>when
Annas was high priest and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John,
the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness. <sup>3</sup>And he came
into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the immersion of
repentance, unto remission of sins, <sup>4</sup>as it is written in
the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:</p>
<p class="pp1">The voice of one crying in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="pp1">Prepare the way of the Lord,</p>
<p class="pp1">Make straight his paths.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>5</sup>Every valley shall be filled,</p>
<p class="pp1">And every mountain and hill shall be brought
low;</p>
<p class="pp1">And the crooked shall be straight,</p>
<p class="pp1">And the rough ways smooth;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>6</sup>And all flesh shall see the salvation of
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>He said therefore to the multitudes that
came out to be immersed by him: Brood of vipers, who warned you to
flee from the coming wrath? <sup>8</sup>Bring forth therefore
fruits worthy of repentance; and begin not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that
God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
<sup>9</sup>And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees.
Every tree therefore, that brings not forth good fruit, is cut down
and cast into the fire.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And the multitudes asked him, saying:
What then shall we do? <sup>11</sup>He answering says to them: He
that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he
that has food, let him do likewise.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And there came also publicans to be
immersed; and they said to him: Teacher, what shall we do?
<sup>13</sup>And he said to them: Exact no more than that which is
appointed you. <sup>14</sup>And soldiers also asked him, saying:
What shall we also do? And he said to them: Do violence to no one,
neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your
wages<sup><a href="#r420314" id="f420314" title="see footnote"
name="f420314">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And while the people were in
expectation, and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning
John, whether he himself were not the Christ, <sup>16</sup>John
answered them all, saying: I indeed immerse you in water; but there
comes he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am
not worthy to loose; he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and
fire; <sup>17</sup>whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly
cleanse his threshing-floor, and will gather the wheat into his
garner; but the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And with many other exhortations he
published the good tidings to the people.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved
by him on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother, and for all
the evils which Herod did, <sup>20</sup>added to all this also,
that he shut up John in prison.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Now it came to pass, when all the
people had been immersed, that as Jesus, having also been immersed,
was praying, the heaven was opened, <sup>22</sup>and the Holy
Spirit descended in a bodily shape as a dove upon him; and there
came a voice out of heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am

I give thee, and the glory of them; because it has been delivered
to me, and I give it to whomsoever I will. <sup>7</sup>If thou
therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. <sup>8</sup>And
Jesus answering said to him: It is written, <span class="ot">Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
serve.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set
him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him: If thou art the
Son of God, cast thyself down from hence. <sup>10</sup>For it is
written: <span class="ot">He will give his angels command
concerning thee, to keep thee;</span> <sup>11</sup><span class=
"ot">and on their hands they shall bear thee up, lest haply thou
dash thy foot against a stone.</span> <sup>12</sup>And Jesus
answering said to him: It is said, <span class="ot">Thou shalt not
tempt the Lord thy God.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And having finished every temptation,
the Devil departed from him for a season.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And Jesus returned in the power of the
Spirit into Galilee; and there went out a report concerning him
through all the surrounding country. <sup>15</sup>And he taught in
their synagogues, being honored by all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And he came to Nazareth, where he had
been brought up. And, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue
on the sabbath day; and he stood up to read. <sup>17</sup>And there
was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And unrolling
the book, he found the place where it was written:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>18</sup>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me;</p>
<p class="pp1">Because he anointed me to publish good tidings to
the poor;</p>
<p class="pp1">He has sent me to proclaim deliverance to the
captives,</p>
<p class="pp1">And recovering of sight to the blind,</p>
<p class="pp1">To send the oppressed away free,</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>19</sup>To proclaim the acceptable year of the
Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And rolling up the book he gave it
again to the servant, and sat down. And the eyes of all in the
synagogue were fastened on him. <sup>21</sup>And he began to say to
them: To-day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
<sup>22</sup>And all bore witness to him, and wondered at the words
of grace which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said: Is not
this Joseph's son? <sup>23</sup>And he said to them: Ye will surely
say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself. Whatever we heard
done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country. <sup>24</sup>And he
said: Verily I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own
country. <sup>25</sup>But I tell you of a truth, there were many
widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up
three years and six months, when there was a great famine
throughout all the land; <sup>26</sup>and to none of them was
Elijah sent, but unto Zarephath of Sidonia, to a woman that was a
widow. <sup>27</sup>And there were many lepers in Israel, in the
time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only
Naaman the Syrian. <sup>28</sup>And all in the synagogue, when they
heard these things, were filled with wrath. <sup>29</sup>And they
rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of
the hill whereon their city was built, to cast him down headlong.
<sup>30</sup>But he, passing through the midst of them, went
away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And he came down to Capernaum, a city
of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath;
<sup>32</sup>and they were astonished at his teaching, because his
word was with power.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And in the synagogue there was a man
having a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud
voice, <sup>34</sup>saying: Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus
of Nazareth? Didst thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
art, the Holy One of God. <sup>35</sup>And Jesus rebuked him,
saying: Hold thy peace, and come out from him. And the demon
throwing him in the midst came out from him, doing him no harm.
<sup>36</sup>And amazement came on all; and they spoke with one
another, saying: What is this word, that with authority and power
he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out?
<sup>37</sup>And there went out a rumor concerning him into every
place of the country around.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And he rose up and went from the
synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And the
mother-in-law of Simon was seized with a violent fever<sup><a href=
"#r420438" id="f420438" title="see footnote" name=
"f420438">38</a></sup>; and they besought him for her.
<sup>39</sup>And standing over her he rebuked the fever, and it
left her; and immediately she arose and ministered to them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>Now when the sun was setting, all that
had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid
his hands on each one of them, and healed them. <sup>41</sup>And
demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying: Thou art
the Son of God. And he, rebuking them, suffered them not to speak,
because they knew that he was the Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>42</sup>And when it was day he went out, and
went into a desert place. And the multitudes sought him, and came
to him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
<sup>43</sup>And he said to them: I must publish the good news of
the kingdom of God to other cities also; because for this I was
sent forth. <sup>44</sup>And he preached in the synagogues of
Galilee.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=
"sc">nd</span> it came to pass, as the multitude pressed upon him
to hear the word of God, and he was standing by the lake of
Gennesaret, <sup>2</sup>that he saw two ships standing by the lake;
but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing the nets.
<sup>3</sup>And entering into one of the ships, which was Simon's,
he asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down,
he taught the multitudes out of the ship.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And when he ceased speaking, he said to
Simon: Put out into the deep; and do ye let down your nets for a
draught. <sup>5</sup>And Simon answering said to him: Master, we
toiled all night and took nothing; but at thy word I will let down
the net. <sup>6</sup>And having done this, they inclosed a great
multitude of fishes; and their net began to break. <sup>7</sup>And
they beckoned to their partners in the other ship, to come and help
them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began
to sink. <sup>8</sup>And Simon Peter, seeing it, fell down at the
knees of Jesus, saying: Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O
Lord. <sup>9</sup>For astonishment had seized him, and all that
were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken;
<sup>10</sup>and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who
were partners with Simon.</p>
<p class="pin">And Jesus said to Simon: Fear not; from henceforth
thou shalt catch men. <sup>11</sup>And having brought their ships
to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And it came to pass, when he was in one
of the cities, that there was a man full of leprosy. And seeing
Jesus he fell on his face, and besought him, saying: Lord, if thou
wilt, thou canst cleanse me. <sup>13</sup>And stretching forth his
hand he touched him, saying: I will; be thou cleansed. And
immediately the leprosy departed from him. <sup>14</sup>And he
charged him to tell no one: But go, and show thyself to the priest,
and offer for thy cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to
them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>But all the more went abroad the report
concerning him; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to
be healed of their infirmities. <sup>16</sup>And he was wont to
retire into the solitary places, and pray.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And it came to pass, on a certain day,
that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the
law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, and
Jud&aelig;a, and Jerusalem; and there was power of the Lord for
healing them. <sup>18</sup>And, behold, men brought on a bed a man
who was palsied; and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him
before him. <sup>19</sup>And not finding by what way they might
bring him in, because of the multitude, they went upon the
housetop, and let him down through the tiling with the couch into
the midst before Jesus. <sup>20</sup>And seeing their faith he
said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. <sup>21</sup>And the scribes
and the Pharisees began to reason, saying: Who is this that speaks
blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? <sup>22</sup>But
Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answering said to them: What
reason ye in your hearts? <sup>23</sup>Which is easier, to say, Thy
sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk? <sup>24</sup>But
that ye may know that the Son of man has power on the earth to
forgive sins, (he said to the palsied man,) I say to thee, arise,
and taking up thy couch go to thy house. <sup>25</sup>And
immediately standing up before them, he took up that whereon he
lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God. <sup>26</sup>And
they were all amazed; and they glorified God, and were filled with
fear, saying: We have seen strange things to-day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And after these things he went forth,
and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of receiving
custom; and he said to him: Follow me. <sup>28</sup>And leaving
all, he arose and followed him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And Levi made him a great feast in his
own house; and there was a great company of publicans and of others
who reclined at the table with them. <sup>30</sup>And the
Pharisees, and their scribes<sup><a href="#r420530" id="f420530"
title="see footnote" name="f420530">30</a></sup>, murmured against
his disciples, saying: Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans
and sinners? <sup>31</sup>And Jesus answering said to them: They
who are well need not a physician, but they who are sick.
<sup>32</sup>I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners to
repentance.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And they said to him: Why do the
disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise those
of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink? <sup>34</sup>And he said
to them: Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast,
<sup><a href="#r420534" id="f420534" title="see footnote" name=
"f420534">34</a></sup> while the bridegroom is with them?
<sup>35</sup>But days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken
away from them; then shall they fast in those days.
<sup>36</sup>And he spoke also a parable to them: No one rends a
piece from a new garment, and puts it on an old garment; else both
the new will make a rent, and the piece from the new agrees not
with the old. <sup>37</sup>And no one puts new wine into old skins;
else the new wine will burst the skins, and will itself be poured
out, and the skins will perish. <sup>38</sup>But new wine must be
put into new skins, and both are preserved together<sup><a href=
"#r420538" id="f420538" title="see footnote" name=
"f420538">38</a></sup>. <sup>39</sup>And no one having drunk old
wine straightway desires new; for he says: The old is
better<sup><a href="#r420539" id="f420539" title="see footnote"
name="f420539">39</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

pass on the second sabbath after the first<sup><a href="#r420601"
id="f420601" title="see footnote" name="f420601">1</a></sup>, that
he was going through grain-fields; and his disciples plucked and
ate the ears of grain, rubbing them with their hands.
<sup>2</sup>And some of the Pharisees said: Why do ye that which it
is not lawful to do on the sabbath? <sup>3</sup>And Jesus answering
them said: And have ye not read this, what David did when he
hungered, himself and they who were with him; <sup>4</sup>how he
went into the house of God, and took and ate the show-bread, and
gave to those who were with him, which it is not lawful to eat
except for the priests alone? <sup>5</sup>And he said to them: The
Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And it came to pass also on another
sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught. And there
was a man whose right hand was withered. <sup>7</sup>And the
scribes and Pharisees were watching, whether he would heal on the
sabbath; that they might find an accusation against him.
<sup>8</sup>But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man having
the withered hand: Arise, and stand forth in the midst. And he rose
up, and stood. <sup>9</sup>Then said Jesus to them: I will ask you
what is lawful<sup><a href="#r420609" id="f420609" title=
"see footnote" name="f420609">9</a></sup> on the sabbath, to do
good, or to do evil; to save life, or to destroy it?
<sup>10</sup>And looking round on them all, he said to him: Stretch
forth thy hand. And he did so, and his hand was restored.
<sup>11</sup>And they were filled with madness, and conferred one
with another, as to what they should do to Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And it came to pass in those days, that
he went out into the mountain to pray, and continued all night in
prayer to God. <sup>13</sup>And when it was day, he called to him
his disciples. And having chosen from them twelve (whom he named
also apostles); <sup>14</sup>Simon, whom he also named Peter, and
Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
<sup>15</sup>and Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and
Simon called Zelotes, <sup>16</sup>and Judas brother of James, and
Judas Iscariot, who became a betrayer; <sup>17</sup>and having come
down with them, he stood on a plain, and a company of his
disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Jud&aelig;a and
Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear
him, and to be healed of their diseases; <sup>18</sup>and those
vexed by unclean spirits were healed; <sup>19</sup>and all the
multitude sought to touch him, because power went out from him and
healed them all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And he, lifting up his eyes on his
disciples, said: Happy are ye poor; for yours is the kingdom of
God. <sup>21</sup>Happy are ye that hunger now; for ye shall be
filled. Happy are ye that weep now; for ye shall laugh.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>Happy are ye, when men shall hate you,
and when they shall separate you from them, and shall reproach you,
and cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of man.
<sup>23</sup>Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for, behold,
your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their
fathers to the prophets.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>But woe to you that are rich; for ye
have received your consolation. <sup>25</sup>Woe to you that are
full; for ye shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now; for ye shall
mourn and weep. <sup>26</sup>Woe! when all men shall speak well of
you; for in the same manner did their fathers to the false
prophets.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>But I say to you who hear: Love your
enemies, do good to those who hate you, <sup>28</sup>bless those
who curse you, pray for those who abuse you<sup><a href="#r420628"
id="f420628" title="see footnote" name="f420628">28</a></sup>.
<sup>29</sup>To him who smites thee on the cheek offer also the
other; and him who takes away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat
also.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>Give to every one that asks of thee;
and of him who takes away thy goods demand them not again.
<sup>31</sup>And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also
in like manner to them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>For if ye love those who love you, what
thanks have ye? For even the sinners love those who love them.
<sup>33</sup>And if ye do good to those who do good to you, what
thanks have ye? For even the sinners do the same. <sup>34</sup>And
if ye lend to those of whom ye hope to receive, what thanks have
ye? And sinners lend to sinners, that they may receive as much in
return.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>But love your enemies, and do good, and
lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward shall be great,
and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the
unthankful and evil. <sup>36</sup>Be ye merciful, as your Father
also is merciful.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>And judge not, and ye shall not be
judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; acquit, and ye
shall be acquitted.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>Give, and it shall be given to you;
good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall
they give into your bosom. For with the same measure with which ye
mete it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And he spoke also a parable to them:
Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the
ditch? <sup>40</sup>A disciple is not above the teacher; but every
one shall be perfected as his teacher.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And why beholdest thou the mote that is
in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine
own eye?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>42</sup>How canst thou say to thy brother:
Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou
thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Hypocrite!
cast out first the beam out of thine eye, and then thou shalt see
clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>For there is no good tree that bears
corrupt fruit, nor corrupt tree that bears good fruit.
<sup>44</sup>For every tree is known from its own fruit. For from
thorns they do not gather figs, nor from a bramble bush do they
harvest grapes. <sup>45</sup>The good man out of the good treasure
of his heart brings forth that which is good; and the evil, out of
the evil, brings forth that which is evil; for out of the abundance
of the heart his mouth speaks.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do
not the things which I say? <sup>47</sup>Every one that comes to
me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he
is like. <sup>48</sup>He is like a man building a house, who digged
deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose,
the stream burst upon that house, and could not shake it; because
it was well builded. <sup>49</sup>But he that hears, and does not,
is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a
foundation; on which the stream burst, and immediately it
fell<sup><a href="#r420649" id="f420649" title="see footnote" name=
"f420649">49</a></sup>; and the ruin of that house was great.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">hen</span> he
completed all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered
into Capernaum. <sup>2</sup>And a certain centurion's servant, who
was dear to him, was sick and about to die. <sup>3</sup>And having
heard concerning Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking
him that he would come and heal his servant. <sup>4</sup>And they,
coming to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying: He is worthy that
thou shouldst do this for him; <sup>5</sup>for he loves our nation,
and himself built our synagogue.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And Jesus went with them. And when he
was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him,
saying to him: Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that
thou shouldst enter under my roof. <sup>7</sup>Wherefore neither
thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but say with a word, and
my servant will be healed. <sup>8</sup>For I am a man placed under
authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, Go, and
he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do
this, and he does it. <sup>9</sup>And Jesus hearing these things,
marveled at him; and turning said to the multitude that followed
him: I say to you, I found not so great faith, even in Israel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And they who were sent, returning to
the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And it came to pass the day after, that
he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went
with him, and a great multitude. <sup>12</sup>And as he came near
to the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was carried out, the
only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude
of the city was with her. <sup>13</sup>And seeing her, the Lord had
compassion on her, and said to her: Weep not. <sup>14</sup>And he
came and touched the bier; and they who bore it stood still. And he
said: Young man, I say to thee, arise. <sup>15</sup>And the dead
sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
<sup>16</sup>And fear seized on all; and they glorified God,
saying: A great prophet has arisen among us; and, God has visited
his people. <sup>17</sup>And this report went forth in all
Jud&aelig;a concerning him, and in all the country around.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And the disciples of John reported to
him concerning all these things. <sup>19</sup>And John calling to
him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying: Art thou he
that comes, or look we for another? <sup>20</sup>And coming to him,
the men said: John the Immerser has sent us to thee, saying: Art
thou he that comes, or look we for another? <sup>21</sup>And in
that very hour he cured many, of diseases and plagues, and evil
spirits; and on many blind he bestowed sight. <sup>22</sup>And
answering he said to them: Go, and report to John what ye saw and
heard; that the blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are
cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor good
tidings are published. <sup>23</sup>And happy is he, whoever shall
not be offended at me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And when the messengers of John had
departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What
went ye out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the
wind?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>But what went ye out to see? A man
clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who are gorgeously appareled,
and live delicately, are in kings' palaces.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>But what went ye out to see? A prophet?
Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet. <sup>27</sup>This
is he, of whom it is written:</p>
<p class="pp1">Behold, I send forth my messenger before thy
face,</p>
<p class="pp1">Who shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>For I say to you, among those born of
women, no one is a greater prophet than John; but he that is least
in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And all the people, hearing it, and the
publicans, justified God, having been immersed with John's
immersion. <sup>30</sup>But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected
the counsel of God toward themselves, not having been immersed by
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>To what then shall I liken the men of
this generation? And to what are they like? <sup>32</sup>They are
like to children sitting in the market, and calling to one another,
saying: We piped to you, and ye danced not; we sang the lament to
you, and ye wept not. <sup>33</sup>For John the Immerser has come,
neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say: He has a demon.
<sup>34</sup>The Son of man has come eating and drinking; and ye
say: Behold a glutton, and a wine-drinker, a friend of publicans
and sinners. <sup>35</sup>But wisdom was justified on the part of
all her children.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And one of the Pharisees asked him to
eat with him. And entering into the house of the Pharisee, he
reclined at table. <sup>37</sup>And, behold, a woman who was a
sinner in the city, learning that he is reclining at table in the
house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of ointment;
<sup>38</sup>and standing behind at his feet weeping, began to wet
his feet with tears, and wipe them with the hairs of her head, and
kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And seeing it, the Pharisee who had
bidden him spoke within himself, saying: This man, if he were a
prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is that touches
him; for she is a sinner. <sup>40</sup>And Jesus answering said to
him: Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he says: Teacher,
say on. <sup>41</sup>A certain money-lender had two debtors. The
one owed five hundred den&aacute;ries<sup><a href="#r420741" id=
"f420741" title="see footnote" name="f420741">41</a></sup>, and the
other fifty. <sup>42</sup>And they having nothing to pay, he
forgave them both. Which of them therefore, tell me, will love him
most? <sup>43</sup>Simon answering said: I suppose he to whom he
forgave most. And he said to him: Thou didst rightly judge.
<sup>44</sup>And turning to the woman, he said to Simon: Seest thou
this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gayest me no water for
my feet; but she has wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with
her hair. <sup>45</sup>Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, from the
time I came in, ceased not to kiss my feet. <sup>46</sup>My head
with oil thou didst not anoint; but she anointed my feet with
ointment. <sup>47</sup>Wherefore I say to thee, her many sins are
forgiven; for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the
same loves little. <sup>48</sup>And he said to her: Thy sins are
forgiven. <sup>49</sup>And they who reclined with him began to say
within themselves: Who is this that also forgives sins?
<sup>50</sup>And he said to the woman: Thy faith has saved thee; go
in peace.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

to pass afterward, that he journeyed through every city and
village, preaching, and publishing the good news of the kingdom of
God; and with him the twelve, <sup>2</sup>and certain women who had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called the
Magdalene, from whom had gone out seven demons, <sup>3</sup>and
Joanna wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many
others, who ministered to them of their substance.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And a great multitude coming together,
of those also who came to him out of every city, he spoke by a
parable: <sup>5</sup>The sower went forth to sow his seed. And as
he sowed, one fell by the way-side; and it was trodden down, and
the fowls of the air devoured it. <sup>6</sup>And another fell upon
the rock; and springing up, it withered away, because it had no
moisture. <sup>7</sup>And another fell among the thorns; and the
thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. <sup>8</sup>And another
fell into the good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit a
hundredfold.</p>
<p class="pin">And saying these things, he cried: He that has ears
to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And his disciples asked him, what this
parable was. <sup>10</sup>And he said: To you it is given to know
the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables,
that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not
understand.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Now the parable is this: The seed is
the word of God. <sup>12</sup>Those by the way-side are they that
hear; after that comes the Devil, and takes away the word from
their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
<sup>13</sup>Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, with
joy receive the word; and these have no root, who for a while
believe, and in time of temptation fall away. <sup>14</sup>And that
which fell among the thorns, these are they who have heard, and
going forth are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of
life, and bring no fruit to perfection. <sup>15</sup>But that in
the good ground, these are they who, in an honest and good heart,
having heard, hold fast the word, and bring forth fruit with
patience.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>No one, having lighted a lamp, covers
it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a
lamp-stand, that they who enter in may behold the light.
<sup>17</sup>For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest,
nor hidden, that shall not be known and come abroad.
<sup>18</sup>Take heed therefore how ye hear. For whoever has, to
him shall be given; and whoever has not, even what he seems to have
shall be taken from him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And his mother and his brothers came to
him; and they could not come near him on account of the multitude.
<sup>20</sup>And it was told him, saying: Thy mother and thy
brothers are standing without, desiring to see thee.
<sup>21</sup>And he answering, said to them: My mother and my
brothers are these, who hear and do the word of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And it came to pass on a certain day,
that he went into a ship with his disciples. And he said to them:
Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched
forth. <sup>23</sup>And as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And
there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they began to be
filled, and were in jeopardy. <sup>24</sup>And coming to him, they
awoke him, saying: Master, Master, we perish. And he, rising,
rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and
there was a calm. <sup>25</sup>And he said to them: Where is your
faith? And they, fearing, wondered; saying one to another: Who then
is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they
obey him!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And they sailed to the country of the
Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee. <sup>27</sup>And when he
had gone forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of
the city, who had demons a long time, and wore no clothing, and
abode not in a house, but in the tombs. <sup>28</sup>And seeing
Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud
voice said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most
high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me. <sup>29</sup>For he
commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For of a
long time it had seized him, and he was bound, being secured with
chains and fetters; and bursting the bands, he was driven by the
demon into the deserts.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And Jesus asked him, saying: What is
thy name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into
him. <sup>31</sup>And he besought him that he would not command
them to go away into the abyss. <sup>32</sup>And there was a herd
of many swine feeding in the mountain; and they besought him that
he would permit them to enter into them. And he permitted them.
<sup>33</sup>And going out of the man, the demons entered into the
swine; and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were
choked. <sup>34</sup>And seeing what was done the herdsmen fled,
and reported it in the city and in the country, <sup>35</sup>And
they went out to see what was done. And they came to Jesus, and
found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at the
feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
<sup>36</sup>They also who saw it reported to them how he that was
possessed by demons was healed. <sup>37</sup>And the whole
multitude of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes besought him
to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear.</p>
<p class="pin">And he, entering into the ship, returned.
<sup>38</sup>And the man, out of whom the demons had gone, besought
him that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying:
<sup>39</sup>Return into thy house, and relate how great things God
did for thee. And he departed, and published through the whole city
how great things Jesus did for him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>And it came to pass, when Jesus
returned, that the multitude received him; for they were all
waiting for him. <sup>41</sup>And, behold, there came a man whose
name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling
at the feet of Jesus, he besought him that he would come into his
house; <sup>42</sup>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years
of age, and she was dying. And as he went the multitudes thronged
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>And a woman having a flow of blood
twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could
not be healed by any one, <sup>44</sup>came up behind, and touched
the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood
ceased. <sup>45</sup>And Jesus said: Who is it that touched me? And
when all denied it, Peter and those with him said: Master, the
multitudes throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou: Who is it
that touched me? <sup>46</sup>And Jesus said: Some one touched me;
for I perceived that power has gone out from me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>And the woman, seeing that she was not
concealed, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared
before all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she
was healed immediately. <sup>48</sup>And he said to her: Daughter,
thy faith has made thee whole; go in peace.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>49</sup>While he was yet speaking, there comes
one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him: Thy
daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher. <sup>50</sup>But Jesus
hearing it, answered him: Fear not; only believe, and she shall be
restored.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>51</sup>And entering into the house, he
suffered no one to go in with him, save Peter and James and John,
and the father of the maiden, and the mother. <sup>52</sup>And all
were weeping and bewailing her. And he said: Weep not; she is not
dead, but is sleeping. <sup>53</sup>And they laughed him to scorn,
knowing that she was dead. <sup>54</sup>And he, taking hold of her
by the hand, called, saying: Maiden, arise. <sup>55</sup>And her
spirit returned, and she immediately arose; and he commanded that
food should be given her. <sup>56</sup>And her parents were
astonished. But he charged them to tell no one what was done.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> having
called the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over
all the demons, and to cure diseases. <sup>2</sup>And he sent them
to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <sup>3</sup>And
he said to them: Take nothing for the journey, neither staff, nor
bag, nor bread, nor money, nor have two coats apiece.
<sup>4</sup>And into whatever house ye enter, there abide, and
thence depart. <sup>5</sup>And whoever will not receive you, when
ye go out from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet
for a testimony against them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And going forth, they went through the
villages, publishing the good news, and healing everywhere.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the
things that were done. And he was perplexed, because it was said by
some: John has risen from the dead; <sup>8</sup>and by some: Elijah
has appeared; and by others: One of the old prophets has risen
again. <sup>9</sup>And Herod said: John I beheaded; but who is
this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And the apostles, returning, related to
him all that they did. And taking them with him, he retired
privately to a city called Bethsaida. <sup>11</sup>And the
multitudes, when they knew it, followed him. And receiving them, he
spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those who
had need of healing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And the day began to decline. And the
twelve came, and said to him: Dismiss the multitude, that they may
go into the villages around, and the fields, and lodge, and find
food; for here we are in a desert place. <sup>13</sup>And he said
to them: Do ye give them to eat. And they said: We have not more
than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food
for all this people. <sup>14</sup>For they were about five thousand
men. And he said to his disciples: Make them lie down in companies
of fifty. <sup>15</sup>And they did so, and made them all lie down.
<sup>16</sup>And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he
looked up to heaven and blessed them, and broke, and gave to the
disciples to set before the multitude. <sup>17</sup>And they ate,
and were all filled. And there were taken up of fragments that
remained to them twelve baskets.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And it came to pass, as he was alone
praying, that his disciples were with him; and he asked them,
saying: Who do the multitudes say that I am? <sup>19</sup>They
answering said: John the Immerser; and others, Elijah; and others,
that one of the old prophets has risen again. <sup>20</sup>And he
said to them: But who do ye say that I am? Peter answering said:
The Christ of God. <sup>21</sup>And strictly charging them, he
commanded them to say this to no one; <sup>22</sup>saying: The Son
of man must suffer many things, and be rejected on the part of the
elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and rise on
the third day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And he said to all: If any one will
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily,
and follow me. <sup>24</sup>For whoever will save his life shall
lose it; and whoever may lose his life for my sake, the same shall
save it <sup>25</sup>For what is a man profited, when he has gained
the whole world, and lost or forfeited himself? <sup>26</sup>For
whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of
man be ashamed, when he shall come in his glory, and in that of the
Father and of the holy angels. <sup>27</sup>And I say to you of a
truth, there are some of those standing here, who shall not taste
of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And it came to pass, about eight days
after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and
James, and went up into the mountain to pray. <sup>29</sup>And it
came to pass, while he was praying, that the appearance of his
countenance became changed, and his raiment white and glistening.
<sup>30</sup>And, behold, two men were talking with him, who were
Moses and Elijah; <sup>31</sup>who appeared in glory, and spoke of
his departure, which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>But Peter and they who were with him
were heavy with sleep; and awaking, they saw his glory, and the two
men that stood with him. <sup>33</sup>And it came to pass, that, as
they were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus: Master, it is
good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee,
and one for Moses, and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said.
<sup>34</sup>While he said this, there came a cloud, and
overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
<sup>35</sup>And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying: This
is my chosen Son; hear ye him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And when the voice had come, Jesus was
found alone. And they kept silent, and told no one in those days
any of the things which they had seen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>And it came to pass, on the next day,
when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude
met him. <sup>38</sup>And, behold, a man from the multitude cried,
saying: Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is my
only child. <sup>39</sup>And, behold, a spirit takes him, and he
suddenly cries out; and it tears him with foaming, and hardly
departs from him, bruising him. <sup>40</sup>And I entreated thy
disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And Jesus answering said: O faithless
and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear
with you? Bring hither thy son. <sup>42</sup>And while he was yet
coming, the demon threw him down, and tore him. And Jesus rebuked
the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his
father. <sup>43</sup>And all were amazed at the mighty power of
God.</p>
<p class="pin">But while all were wondering at all things which
Jesus did, he said to his disciples: <sup>44</sup>Do ye let these
words sink into your ears, for the Son of man will be delivered
into the hands of men. <sup>45</sup>But they understood not this
saying, and it was hidden from them, that they perceived it not;
and they feared to ask him concerning that saying.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>And there arose in them the
thought<sup><a href="#r420946" id="f420946" title="see footnote"
name="f420946">46</a></sup>, which of them was greatest.
<sup>47</sup>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took
a child and placed it by him, <sup>48</sup>and said to them:
Whoever shall receive this child in my name, receives me; and
whoever shall receive me, receives him who sent me; for he that is
least among you all, the same is great.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>49</sup>And John answering said: Master, we saw
one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he
follows not with us. <sup>50</sup>And Jesus said to him: Forbid him
not; for he that is not against us is for us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>51</sup>And it came to pass, when the days were
being completed that he should be received up, he steadfastly set
his face to go to Jerusalem. <sup>52</sup>And he sent messengers
before his face; and they went and entered into a village of the
Samaritans, to make ready for him. <sup>53</sup>And they did not
receive him, because his face was directed toward Jerusalem.
<sup>54</sup>And his disciples, James and John, seeing it, said:
Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and
consume them, as also Elijah did? <sup>55</sup>And he turned, and
rebuked them, and said: Ye know not<sup><a href="#r420955" id=
"f420955" title="see footnote" name="f420955">55</a></sup> of what
spirit ye are. <sup>56</sup>And they went to another village.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>57</sup>And as they were going in the way, a
certain one said to him: I will follow thee whithersoever thou
goest. <sup>58</sup>And Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes,
and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not
where to lay his head.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>59</sup>And he said to another: Follow me. But
he said: Lord permit me first to go and bury my father.
<sup>60</sup>And he said to him: Let the dead bury their own dead;
but do thou go and announce the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>61</sup>And another also said; I will follow
thee, Lord; but first permit me to bid farewell to those in my
house. <sup>62</sup>And Jesus said to him: No one, having put his
hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of
God.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=
"sc">fter</span> these things the Lord appointed also seventy
others, and sent them two and two before his face, into every city
and place, whither he himself was about to come. <sup>2</sup>And he
said to them: The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are
few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send
forth laborers into his harvest. <sup>3</sup>Go your ways; behold,
I send you forth as lambs among wolves. <sup>4</sup>Carry neither
purse, nor bag, nor sandals; and salute no one by the way.
<sup>5</sup>And into whatever house ye enter, first say: Peace be
to this house. <sup>6</sup>And if a son of peace be there, your
peace shall rest upon it; and if not, it shall return to you.
<sup>7</sup>And in that house remain, eating and drinking such
things as they give<sup><a href="#r421007" id="f421007" title=
"see footnote" name="f421007">7</a></sup>; for the laborer is
worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. <sup>8</sup>And
into whatever city ye enter and they receive you, eat what is set
before you; <sup>9</sup>and heal the sick that are therein, and say
to them: The kingdom of God has come nigh unto you.
<sup>10</sup>But into whatever city ye enter and they receive you
not, go out into the streets of the same, and say:
<sup>11</sup>Even the dust of your city that cleaves to our feet,
we wipe off to you<sup><a href="#r421011" id="f421011" title=
"see footnote" name="f421011">11</a></sup>; yet know this, that the
kingdom of God has come nigh. <sup>12</sup>I say to you, that it
will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that
city.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Woe to thee, Chorazin! Woe to thee,
Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
which were done in you, they would long ago have repented, sitting
in sackcloth and ashes. <sup>14</sup>But it will be more tolerable
for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you. <sup>15</sup>And
thou, Capernaum, that art exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down
to the underworld.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>He that hears you, hears me; and he
that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects him
who sent me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And the seventy returned with joy,
saying: Lord, even the demons are subjected to us in thy name.
<sup>18</sup>And he said to them: I beheld Satan fall as lightning
from heaven. <sup>19</sup>Behold, I have given you power to tread
on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and
nothing shall hurt you. <sup>20</sup>But yet, rejoice not in this,
that the spirits are subjected to you; but rejoice, that your names
are written in heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>In that hour he rejoiced in spirit, and
said: I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou
didst hide these things from the wise and discerning, and reveal
them to babes; yea, O Father, that so it seemed good in thy sight.
<sup>22</sup>All things were delivered to me by my Father; and no
one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but
the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And turning to the disciples, he said
privately: Happy are the eyes that behold what ye are beholding.
<sup>24</sup>For I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired
to see what ye are beholding, and saw not, and to hear what ye are
hearing, and heard not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up,
tempting him, saying: Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal
life? <sup>26</sup>He said to him: What is written in the law? How
readest thou? <sup>27</sup>And he answering said: <span class=
"ot">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and
thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <sup>28</sup>And he said to him:
Thou answeredst rightly. This do, and thou shalt live.
<sup>29</sup>But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus:
Who then is my neighbor?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And Jesus answering said: A certain man
was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers,
who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed,
leaving him half dead. <sup>31</sup>And by chance a certain priest
was going down that way; and seeing him, he passed by on the other
side. <sup>32</sup>And in like manner also a Levite, arriving at
the place, came and saw, and passed by on the other side.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And a certain Samaritan, as he was
journeying, came where he was, and seeing him had compassion;
<sup>34</sup>and coming to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil
and wine; and setting him on his own beast, he brought him to an
inn, and took care of him. <sup>35</sup>And on the morrow when he
departed, he took out two den&aacute;ries<sup><a href="#r421035"
id="f421035" title="see footnote" name="f421035">35</a></sup> and
gave to the host, and said: Take care of him; and whatever thou
spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>Which now of these three, thinkest
thou, was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers?
<sup>37</sup>And he said: He that had mercy on him. And Jesus said
to him: Go, and do thou likewise.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And it came to pass, as they were
going, that he entered into a certain village; and a certain woman
named Martha received him into her house. <sup>39</sup>And she had
a sister called Mary, who also sat at the feet of Jesus, and heard
his word. <sup>40</sup>But Martha was encumbered with much serving;
and she came to him, and said: Lord, dost thou not care that my
sister left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me.
<sup>41</sup>And Jesus answering said to her: Martha, Martha, thou
art anxious and troubled about many things. <sup>42</sup>But one
thing is needful; and Mary chose the good part, which shall not be
taken away from her.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> it came to
pass that, as he was in a certain place praying, when he ceased,
one of his disciples said to him: Lord, teach us to pray, as also
John taught his disciples. <sup>2</sup>And he said to them: When ye
pray, say; Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
<sup>3</sup>Give us day by day our daily bread<sup><a href=
"#r421103" id="f421103" title="see footnote" name=
"f421103">3</a></sup>. <sup>4</sup>And forgive us our sins; for we
ourselves forgive every one indebted to us. And bring us not into
temptation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And he said to them: Who of you shall
have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him:
<sup>6</sup>Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine is
come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;
<sup>7</sup>and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me
not; the door is already shut, and my children with me are in bed;
I can not rise and give thee? <sup>8</sup>I say to you, though he
will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of
his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs.
<sup>9</sup>I also say to you: Ask, and it shall be given you;
seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
<sup>10</sup>For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks
finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And what father is there among you, of
whom if his son ask bread, he will give him a stone; or a fish,
will instead of a fish give him a serpent? <sup>12</sup>Or if he
shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion? <sup>13</sup>If ye
then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those
who ask him?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And he was casting out a demon, and it
was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, that
the dumb man spoke; and the multitudes wondered. <sup>15</sup>But
some of them said: He casts out the demons through Beelzebul, the
prince of the demons. <sup>16</sup>And others, tempting, sought of
him a sign from heaven. <sup>17</sup>But he, knowing their
thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is
brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house
falls<sup><a href="#r421117" id="f421117" title="see footnote"
name="f421117">17</a></sup>. <sup>18</sup>And if Satan also is
divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye
say that I cast out the demons through Beelzebul. <sup>19</sup>And
if I through Beelzebul cast out the demons, through whom do your
sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
<sup>20</sup>But if with the finger of God I cast out the demons,
then is the kingdom of God come near to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>When a strong man armed keeps his
palace, his goods are in peace. <sup>22</sup>But when a stronger
than he shall come upon him and overcome him, he takes away his
whole armor, wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>He that is not with me is against me;
and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>When the unclean spirit is gone out
from the man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and not
finding it, he says, I will return into my house whence I came out.
<sup>25</sup>And coming, he finds it swept and set in order.
<sup>26</sup>Then he goes, and takes with him seven other spirits
more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there; and
the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And it came to pass, as he was saying
these things, that a certain woman lifting up her voice from the
multitude, said to him: Happy the womb that bore thee, and breasts
which thou didst suck! <sup>28</sup>And he said: Yea, rather, Happy
they who hear the word of God, and keep it!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And the multitudes gathering more and
more, he began to say: This generation is an evil generation. It
seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonah.
<sup>30</sup>For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so shall
also the Son of man be to this generation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>A queen of the south will rise up in
the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn
them; because she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear
the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
<sup>32</sup>Men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment with this
generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at the
preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>No one, having lighted a lamp, puts it
in a secret place, or under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand, that
they who come in may see the light. <sup>34</sup>The lamp of the
body is thine eye. When thine eye is single, thy whole body also is
light; but when it is evil, thy body also is dark.
<sup>35</sup>Take heed therefore, lest the light that is in thee is
darkness<sup><a href="#r421135" id="f421135" title="see footnote"
name="f421135">35</a></sup>. <sup>36</sup>If therefore thy whole
body is light, having no part dark, it shall be all light as when
the lamp, with its bright shining, gives thee light.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>And as he was speaking, a Pharisee
asked him to dine with him and he went in, and reclined at table.
<sup>38</sup>And the Pharisee, seeing it, wondered that he did not
first immerse himself before dinner. <sup>39</sup>And the Lord said
to him: Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the
platter; but your inward part is full of rapacity and wickedness.
<sup>40</sup>Fools! Did not he, who made the outside, make the
inside also? <sup>41</sup>But give that which ye have in
alms<sup><a href="#r421141" id="f421141" title="see footnote" name=
"f421141">41</a></sup>; and, behold, all things are clean to
you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>42</sup>But woe to you, Pharisees! because ye
pay tithe of mint and rue and every herb, and pass by judgment and
the love of God. These ought ye to have done, and not leave those
undone.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>Woe to you, Pharisees! because ye love
the first seat in the synagogues, and the greetings in the
markets.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>Woe to you! because ye are as tombs
that appear not, and men walking over them know it not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>And a certain one of the lawyers
answering says to him: Teacher, in saying these things thou
reproachest us also. <sup>46</sup>And he said: Woe to you lawyers
also! because ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye
yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>Woe to you! because ye build the
sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
<sup>48</sup>So then ye bear witness to and approve the deeds of
your fathers; because they indeed killed them, and ye build their
sepulchres<sup><a href="#r421148" id="f421148" title="see footnote"
name="f421148">48</a></sup>. <sup>49</sup>Therefore also said the
wisdom of God: I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of
them they will slay and persecute; <sup>50</sup>that the blood of
all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world,
may be required of this generation, <sup>51</sup>from the blood of
Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar
and the temple. Verily I say to you, it shall be required of this
generation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>52</sup>Woe to you lawyers! because ye took
away the key of knowledge; ye entered not in yourselves, and those
who were entering in ye hindered.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>53</sup>And as he said these things to them,
the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to
provoke him to speak of many things<sup><a href="#r421153" id=
"f421153" title="see footnote" name="f421153">53</a></sup>;
<sup>54</sup>lying in wait for him, seeking to catch something out
of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I<span class="sc">n</span> the mean
time, the multitude having gathered together in tens of thousands,
so that they trod one upon another, he began first to say to his
disciples: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is
hypocrisy. <sup>2</sup>For there is nothing covered, that shall not
be revealed, nor hidden, that shall not be known.
<sup>3</sup>Wherefore, whatever ye said in the darkness, shall be
heard in the light; and what ye spoke in the ear in closets, shall
be proclaimed on the house-tops.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And I say to you, my friends, be not
afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that
they can do. <sup>5</sup>But I will warn you whom ye shall fear;
fear him, who after he has killed has power to cast into hell; yea,
I say to you, fear him. <sup>6</sup>Are not five sparrows sold for
two pence? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
<sup>7</sup>But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear
not; ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And I say to you: Every one that shall
acknowledge me before men, him will the Son of man also acknowledge
before the angels of God; <sup>9</sup>but he that denied me before
men shall be denied before the angels of God. <sup>10</sup>And
every one that shall speak a word against the Son of man, it will
be forgiven him; but to him that blasphemes against the Holy
Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And when they bring you to the
synagogues, and magistrates, and authorities, take not thought how
or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say. <sup>12</sup>For the
Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what ye ought to
say.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And a certain one of the multitude said
to him: Teacher, speak to my brother, that he divide the
inheritance with me. <sup>14</sup>And he said to him: Man, who made
me a judge or a divider over you? <sup>15</sup>And he said to them:
Take heed, and beware of all covetousness; because a man's life
consists not in the abundance of his possessions.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And he spoke a parable to them, saying:
The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully.
<sup>17</sup>And he thought within himself, saying: What shall I
do, because I have not where to store my fruits? <sup>18</sup>And
he said: This will I do; I will pull down my barns, and will build
greater; and there I will store all my fruits and my goods.
<sup>19</sup>And I will say to my soul: Soul, thou hast many goods
laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.
<sup>20</sup>But God said to him: Fool! this night thy soul shall
be required of thee; and whose shall those things be, which thou
didst provide? <sup>21</sup>So is he that lays up treasure for
himself, and is not rich toward God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And he said to his disciples: Therefore
I say to you, take not thought for the life, what ye shall eat, nor
for the body, what ye shall put on. <sup>23</sup>The life is more
than food, and the body than raiment. <sup>24</sup>Consider the
ravens, that they sow not nor reap; which have neither storehouse
nor barn; and God feeds them. How much better are ye than the
birds! <sup>25</sup>And which of you by taking thought can add a
cubit to his stature<sup><a href="#r421225" id="f421225" title=
"see footnote" name="f421225">25</a></sup>? <sup>26</sup>If
therefore ye can not do even that which is least, why take ye
thought for the rest?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Consider the lilies, how they grow;
they toil not, nor spin; and I say to you, that even Solomon, in
all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <sup>28</sup>And
if God so clothes the grass, which to-day is in the field, and
to-morrow is cast into the oven, how much more you, ye of little
faith? <sup>29</sup>And ye, seek not what ye shall eat, or what ye
shall drink, and be not of a doubtful mind. <sup>30</sup>For all
these things do the nations of the world seek after; and your
Father knows that ye have need of these. <sup>31</sup>But seek his
kingdom, and these things shall be added to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>Fear not, little flock; for it is your
Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. <sup>33</sup>Sell
what ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves purses that wax not
old, a treasure unfailing in the heavens, where a thief approaches
not, nor moth corrupts. <sup>34</sup>For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>Let your loins be girded about, and
your lamps burning; <sup>36</sup>and ye like men waiting for their
lord, when he shall return from the wedding; that, when he comes
and knocks, they may open to him immediately. <sup>37</sup>Happy
those servants, whom their lord when he comes shall find watching!
Verily I say to you, that he will gird himself, and make them
recline at table, and will come forth and serve them.
<sup>38</sup>And if he shall come in the second watch, or in the
third watch, and find it so, happy are those servants.
<sup>39</sup>And this know, that if the master of the house had
known at what hour the thief is coming, he would have watched, and
not have suffered his house to be broken through. <sup>40</sup>Be
ye also ready; for at an hour when ye think not, the Son of man
comes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And Peter said to him: Lord, speakest
thou this parable to us, or also to all? <sup>42</sup>And the Lord
said: Who then is the faithful, the wise steward, whom his lord
will set over his household, to give the portion of food in due
season? <sup>43</sup>Happy that servant, whom his lord when he
comes shall find so doing! <sup>44</sup>Of a truth I say to you,
that he will make him ruler over all his goods.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>But if that servant say in his heart:
My lord delays his coming; and shall begin to beat the men-servants
and maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
<sup>46</sup>the lord of that servant will come in a day when he
looks not for it, and in an hour when he is not aware, and will cut
him asunder, and appoint his portion with the faithless.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>And that servant, who knew his lord's
will, and prepared not, nor did according to his will, shall be
beaten with many stripes; <sup>48</sup>but he that knew not, and
did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For to
whomsoever much was given, of him much will be required; and to
whom they committed much, of him they will require the more.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>49</sup>I came to send fire upon the earth; and
what will I, if it is already kindled<sup><a href="#r421249" id=
"f421249" title="see footnote" name="f421249">49</a></sup>?
<sup>50</sup>But I have an immersion to undergo; and how am I
straitened till it be accomplished! <sup>51</sup>Suppose ye that I
came to give peace in the earth? I tell you, nay; but only
division. <sup>52</sup>For from this time forth, five in one house
will be divided, three against two, and two against three.
<sup>53</sup>They will be divided, father against son, and son
against father; mother against the daughter, and daughter against
the mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and
daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>54</sup>And he said also to the multitudes:
When ye see the cloud rising from the west, straightway ye say: A
shower is coming and so it comes to pass. <sup>55</sup>And when ye
see a south wind blowing, ye say: There will be heat; and it comes
to pass. <sup>56</sup>Hypocrites! Ye know how to judge of the face
of the earth and the sky; but how is it that ye know not how to
judge of this time? <sup>57</sup>And why even of yourselves do ye
not judge what is right? <sup>58</sup>For when thou art going with
thine adversary to the magistrate, on the way give diligence that
thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he drag thee to the judge,
and the judge deliver thee to the exactor, and the exactor cast
thee into prison. <sup>59</sup>I say to thee, thou shalt not depart
thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">here</span> were
present at that season some who brought him word concerning the
Galil&aelig;ans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.
<sup>2</sup>And answering he said to them: Suppose ye that these
Galil&aelig;ans were sinners above all the Galil&aelig;ans, because
they have suffered such things? <sup>3</sup>I tell you, nay; but,
except ye repent, ye shall all in like manner perish.
<sup>4</sup>Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell,
and slew them, suppose ye that they were sinners above all the men
who dwell in Jerusalem? <sup>5</sup>I tell you, nay; but, except ye
repent, ye shall all in like manner perish.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>He spoke also this parable: A certain
man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking
fruit thereon, and found none. <sup>7</sup>And he said to the
vine-dresser: Behold, three years I come seeking fruit on this
fig-tree, and find none. Cut it down; why does it also
encumber<sup><a href="#r421307" id="f421307" title="see footnote"
name="f421307">7</a></sup> the ground? <sup>8</sup>And he answering
says to him: Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig
about it, and cast in manure. <sup>9</sup>And if it bear fruit
&mdash;; and if not, hereafter thou shalt cut it down<sup><a href=
"#r421309" id="f421309" title="see footnote" name=
"f421309">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And he was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the sabbath. <sup>11</sup>And, behold, there was a
woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed
together, and wholly unable to raise herself up. <sup>12</sup>And
Jesus seeing her, called her to him, and said to her: Woman, thou
art loosed from thine infirmity. <sup>13</sup>And he laid his hands
on her; and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
<sup>14</sup>And the ruler of the synagogue answering (being
indignant because Jesus healed on the sabbath), said to the
multitude: There are six days in which it is proper to work; in
them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath.
<sup>15</sup>And the Lord answered him, and said: Hypocrites! Does
not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the manger,
and lead him away to water him? <sup>16</sup>And ought not this
woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound, lo, eighteen
years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath? <sup>17</sup>And
as he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed; and all
the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done
by him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>He said therefore: To what is the
kingdom of God like? And to what shall I liken it? <sup>19</sup>It
is like to a grain of mustard, which a man took, and cast into his
garden; and it grew, and became a great tree, and the birds of the
air lodged in its branches.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And again he said: To what shall I
liken the kingdom of God? <sup>21</sup>It is like to leaven, which
a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was
leavened.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And he went through cities and
villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And a certain one said to him: Lord,
are there few that are saved? <sup>24</sup>And he said to them:
Strive to enter in through the strait gate; for many, I say to you,
will seek to enter in, and will not be able. <sup>25</sup>When once
the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and ye begin
to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to
us, and he answering shall say to you, I know you not whence ye
are; <sup>26</sup>then will ye begin to say, We ate and drank in
thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets. <sup>27</sup>And
he will say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me,
all workers of unrighteousness. <sup>28</sup>There will be the
weeping, and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and
yourselves thrust out. <sup>29</sup>And they will come from east
and west, and from north and south, and will recline at table in
the kingdom of God. <sup>30</sup>And, behold, there are last who
will be first, and there are first who will be last.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>On that day there came certain
Pharisees, saying to him: Depart, and go hence; for Herod desires
to kill thee. <sup>32</sup>And he said to them: Go, tell that fox,
Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow,
and the third day I am perfected. <sup>33</sup>But yet, I must go
to-day, and to-morrow, and the day following; because it may not be
that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that kills the
prophets, and stones those sent to her; how often would I have
gathered thy children together, as a hen her brood under her wings,
and ye would not! <sup>35</sup>Behold, your house is left to you
desolate. And I say to you: Ye shall not see me, until the time
come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the
Lord.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> it came to
pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief of the
Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath, that they watched him.
<sup>2</sup>And, behold, there was a certain man before him who had
the dropsy. <sup>3</sup>And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers
and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not?
And they were silent. <sup>4</sup>And taking hold of him, he healed
him, and let him go. <sup>5</sup>And to them he said: Who is there
of you, whose ox or ass<sup><a href="#r421405" id="f421405" title=
"see footnote" name="f421405">5</a></sup> shall fall into a pit,
and he will not straightway draw him up on the sabbath day?
<sup>6</sup>And they could not answer him again to these
things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And he spoke a parable to those who were
bidden, when he marked how they chose out the first places; saying
to them: <sup>8</sup>When thou art bidden by any one to a wedding,
recline not in the first place at table, lest one more honorable
than thou may have been bidden by him; <sup>9</sup>and he that bade
thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give place to this man;
and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place.
<sup>10</sup>But when thou art bidden, go and recline in the lowest
place; that when he that bade thee comes, he may say to thee,
Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have honor in the presence of
those who recline at table with thee. <sup>11</sup>For every one
that exalts himself shall be humbled; and he that humbles himself
shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And he said also to him who bade him:
When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor
thy brothers, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest they also
bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. <sup>13</sup>But
when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the
blind. <sup>14</sup>And happy shalt thou be, because they can not
recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection
of the righteous.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And a certain one of those who reclined
at table with him, hearing these things, said to him: Happy is he,
who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God! <sup>16</sup>And he said
to him: A certain man made a great supper, and bade many.
<sup>17</sup>And he sent his servant, at the hour of the supper, to
say to those who were bidden: Come, for all things are now ready.
<sup>18</sup>And they all, with one mind, began<sup><a href=
"#r421418" id="f421418" title="see footnote" name=
"f421418">18</a></sup> to excuse themselves. The first said to him:
I bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go out and see it; I
pray thee let me be excused. <sup>19</sup>And another said: I
bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to make trial of them; I
pray thee let me be excused. <sup>20</sup>And another said: I
married a wife; and therefore I can not come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And the servant came, and reported
these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being
angry, said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and
lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and maimed, and
lame, and blind. <sup>22</sup>And the servant said: Lord, it is
done as thou didst command, and yet there is room. <sup>23</sup>And
the Lord said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges,
and compel them<sup><a href="#r421423" id="f421423" title=
"see footnote" name="f421423">23</a></sup> to come in, that my
house may be filled; <sup>24</sup>for I say to you, that none of
those men who were bidden shall taste of my supper.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And great multitudes were going with
him; and turning, he said to them: <sup>26</sup>If any one comes to
me, and hates not his father, and mother, and wife, and children,
and brothers, and sisters, and even his own life besides, he can
not be my disciple. <sup>27</sup>And whoever does not bear his
cross, and come after me, can not be my disciple. <sup>28</sup>For
who of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down,
and count the cost, whether he has sufficient to finish it?
<sup>29</sup>Lest haply, when he has laid a foundation, and is not
able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him,
<sup>30</sup>saying: This man began to build, and was not able to
finish. <sup>31</sup>Or what king, going to make war against
another king, does not first sit down and consult, whether he is
able, with ten thousand, to meet him who comes against him with
twenty thousand? <sup>32</sup>Else, while he is yet a great way
off, he sends an embassy, and desires conditions of peace.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>So then, whoever of you forsakes not
all that he has can not be my disciple. <sup>34</sup>Salt therefore
is good; but if even the salt has become tasteless, wherewith shall
it be seasoned? <sup>35</sup>It is fit neither for the land, nor
for the dunghill; they cast it out. He that has ears to hear, let
him hear.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> there were
drawing near to him all the publicans and the sinners to hear him.
<sup>2</sup>And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying:
This man receives sinners, and eats with them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And he spoke this parable to them,
saying: <sup>4</sup>What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and
having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the
wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he finds it?
<sup>5</sup>And having found it, he lays it on his shoulders,
rejoicing. <sup>6</sup>And coming home, he calls together his
friends and neighbors, saying to them: Rejoice with me; because I
found my sheep which was lost. <sup>7</sup>I say to you, that so
there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than
over ninety and nine just persons, who have no need of
repentance.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Or what woman having ten pieces of
silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a lamp, and sweep the
house, and seek carefully till she finds it? <sup>9</sup>And having
found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying:
Rejoice with me; because I found the piece which I lost.
<sup>10</sup>So, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner that repents.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And he said: A certain man had two
sons. <sup>12</sup>And the younger of them said to his father:
Father, give me the portion of the property that falls to me. And
he divided to them his living. <sup>13</sup>And not many days
after, the younger son gathered all together, and went abroad into
a far country, and there wasted his substance in riotous living.
<sup>14</sup>And when he had spent all, there arose a grievous
famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
<sup>15</sup>And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens
of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
<sup>16</sup>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks
which the swine ate; and no one gave to him. <sup>17</sup>And
coming to himself, he said: How many hired servants of my father
have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!
<sup>18</sup>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him:
Father, I sinned against heaven, and before thee. <sup>19</sup>I am
no longer worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired
servants.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And he arose, and came to his father.
But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and had
compassion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
<sup>21</sup>And the son said to him: Father, I sinned against
heaven, and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy
son. <sup>22</sup>But the father said to his servants: Bring forth
a robe, the best, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand,
and sandals on his feet; <sup>23</sup>and bring the fatted calf,
and kill it; and let us eat and be merry. <sup>24</sup>Because this
my son was dead and is alive again, was lost and is found. And they
began to be merry.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Now his elder son was in the field. And
as he came, and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
<sup>26</sup>And calling to him one of the servants, he inquired
what these things meant. <sup>27</sup>And he said to him: Thy
brother is come; and thy father killed the fatted calf, because he
received him back, safe and sound. <sup>28</sup>And he was angry,
and would not go in; and his father came out, and entreated him.
<sup>29</sup>And he answering said to his father: Lo, so many years
do I serve thee, and never transgressed thy command; and to me thou
never gayest a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.
<sup>30</sup>But when this thy son came, who devoured thy living
with harlots, thou didst kill for him the fatted calf.
<sup>31</sup>And he said to him: Child, thou art ever with me, and
all that I have is thine. <sup>32</sup>It was meet that we should
make merry, and be glad; because this thy brother was dead and is
alive again; and was lost, and is found.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> he said
also to the disciples: There was a certain rich man, who had a
steward; and the same was accused to him as wasting his goods.
<sup>2</sup>And having called him, he said to him: What is this
that I hear of thee? Give account of thy stewardship; for thou
canst be no longer steward. <sup>3</sup>And the steward said within
himself: What shall I do? for my master takes away from me the
stewardship. I am not able to dig; to beg I am ashamed.
<sup>4</sup>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of
the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
<sup>5</sup>And having called to him each one of his master's
debtors, he said to the first: How much owest thou to my master?
<sup>6</sup>And he said: A hundred measures of oil. And he said to
him: Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
<sup>7</sup>Then he said to another: And how much owest thou? And
he said: A hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him: Take thy
bill, and write fourscore. <sup>8</sup>And the master commended the
unjust steward, because he had done wisely; because the sons of
this world are, in their generation, wiser than the sons of light.
<sup>9</sup>And I say to you: Make to yourselves friends of the
mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it fails, they may receive
you into the everlasting habitations. <sup>10</sup>He that is
faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much; and he
that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. <sup>11</sup>If
therefore ye were not faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will
entrust to you the true riches? <sup>12</sup>And if ye were not
faithful in that which is another's, who will give to you your own?
<sup>13</sup>No servant can serve two masters; for either he will
hate the one, and love the other, or he will hold to one, and
despise the other. Ye can not serve God and Mammon.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And the Pharisees also; who were
covetous, heard all these things; and they derided him.
<sup>15</sup>And he said to them: Ye are they who justify
themselves before men; but God knows your hearts; for that which is
highly esteemed among men is abomination before God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>The law and the prophets were until
John; from that time the good news of the kingdom of God is
published, and every man presses into it. <sup>17</sup>And it is
easier that heaven and earth should pass away, than that one tittle
of the law should fail.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Every one who puts away his wife, and
marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when put
away from a husband commits adultery.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>There was a certain rich man, who was
clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day.
<sup>20</sup>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was
laid at his gate, full of sores, <sup>21</sup>and desiring to be
fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Moreover
the dogs came and licked his sores. <sup>22</sup>And it came to
pass, that the beggar died; and he was borne away by the angels
into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried;
<sup>23</sup>and in the underworld, lifting up his eyes, being in
torments, he sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
<sup>24</sup>And he cried and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on
me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in
water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
<sup>25</sup>But Abraham said: Child, remember that in thy lifetime
thou receivedst thy good things in full, and Lazarus in like manner
his evil things; but now here, he is comforted and thou art
tormented. <sup>26</sup>And besides all this, between us and you a
great gulf is fixed; that they who would pass from hence to you may
not be able, nor those from thence pass over to us.
<sup>27</sup>And he said: I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
wouldst send him to my father's house. <sup>28</sup>For I have five
brothers; that he may testify to them, that they may not also come
into this place of torment. <sup>29</sup>Abraham says to him: They
have Moses and the prophets let them hear them. <sup>30</sup>And he
said: Nay, father Abraham; but if one should go to them from the
dead, they will repent. <sup>31</sup>And he said to him: If they
hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded,
though one should rise from the dead.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> he said
to his disciples: It is impossible that causes of offense should
not come; but woe to him through whom they come! <sup>2</sup>It
were better for him that a mill stone were placed about his neck,
and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of
these little ones to offend.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother
sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. <sup>4</sup>And if
he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn to
thee saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And the apostles said to the Lord:
Increase our faith. <sup>6</sup>And the Lord said: If ye had faith
as a grain of mustard, ye would say to this sycamine-tree, Be thou
plucked up by the root, and planted in the sea; and it would have
obeyed you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And who of you, having a servant
plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him immediately, when he
has come in from the field, Come and recline at table;
<sup>8</sup>and will not rather say to him, Make ready wherewith I
may sup, and gird thyself and serve me, till I have eaten and
drunken, and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? <sup>9</sup>Does
he thank that servant, because he did the things that were
commanded? I think not. <sup>10</sup>So also ye, when ye shall have
done all the things that were commanded you, say, We are
unprofitable servants; we have done that which was our duty to
do.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And it came to pass, as he was going to
Jerusalem, that he went through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
<sup>12</sup>And as he was entering into a certain village, there
met him ten leprous men, who stood afar off. <sup>13</sup>And they
lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
<sup>14</sup>And seeing it, he said to them: Go, show yourselves to
the priests. And it came to pass that, as they went, they were
cleansed. <sup>15</sup>And one of them, seeing that he was healed,
turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God, <sup>16</sup>and
fell down on his face at his feet, giving thanks to him; and he was
a Samaritan. <sup>17</sup>And Jesus answering said: Were not the
ten cleansed? And where are the nine? <sup>18</sup>Were none found
returning to give glory to God, except this stranger?
<sup>19</sup>And he said to him: Arise, and go; thy faith has made
thee whole.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And being asked by the Pharisees, when
the kingdom of God would come, he answered them and said: The
kingdom of God comes not with observation; <sup>21</sup>nor shall
they say, Lo here! or, Lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is
within you<sup><a href="#r421721" id="f421721" title="see footnote"
name="f421721">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And he said to the disciples: Days will
come, when ye will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man,
and ye will not see it. <sup>23</sup>And they will say to you, See
here; or, See there; go not away, and follow not. <sup>24</sup>For
as the lightning, that lightens out of the one part under heaven,
shines unto the other part under heaven, so will the Son of man be
in his day. <sup>25</sup>But first he must suffer many things, and
be rejected on the part of this generation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And as it was in the days of Noah, so
will it be also in the days of the Son of man. <sup>27</sup>They
ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until
the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and
destroyed all. <sup>28</sup>In like manner also as it was in the
days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
planted, they builded; <sup>29</sup>but the same day that Lot went
out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and
destroyed all. <sup>30</sup>After the same manner will it be, in
the day when the Son of man is revealed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>In that day, he who shall be on the
house-top, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to
take them away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not
turn back. <sup>32</sup>Remember Lot's wife. <sup>33</sup>Whoever
shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever may lose his
life shall preserve it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>I say to you, in that night there will
be two men in one bed; one will be taken, and the other will be
left. <sup>35</sup>Two women will be grinding together; one will be
taken, and the other left. <sup>37</sup>And they answering say to
him: Where, Lord? And he said to them: Where the body is, there
also will the eagles be gathered together.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> he spoke
also a parable to them, to the end that they ought always to pray,
and not to faint; <sup>2</sup>saying: There was in a certain city a
certain judge, who feared not God, nor regarded man.
<sup>3</sup>And there was a widow in that city; and she came to
him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary. <sup>4</sup>And he would
not for a while; but afterward he said within himself: Though I
fear not God, nor regard man, <sup>5</sup>yet because this widow
troubles me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary
me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust
judge says. <sup>7</sup>And will not God avenge his chosen, who cry
to him day and night, though he is long suffering in respect to
them? <sup>8</sup>I say to you, that he will avenge them speedily.
But yet, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on the
earth?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And he spoke this parable to some who
trust in themselves that they are righteous, and despise others.
<sup>10</sup>Two men went up into the temple to pray; one a
Pharisee, and the other a publican. <sup>11</sup>The Pharisee
stood, and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee, that I am
not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
publican. <sup>12</sup>I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of
all that I possess<sup><a href="#r421812" id="f421812" title=
"see footnote" name="f421812">12</a></sup>. <sup>13</sup>And the
publican, standing afar off, would not even lift up his eyes to
heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying: God be merciful to me,
the sinner. <sup>14</sup>I say to you, this man went down to his
house justified, rather than the other. For every one that exalts
himself shall be humbled; and he that humbles himself shall be
exalted.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And they brought to him also infants,
that he might touch them; and the disciples seeing it rebuked them.
<sup>16</sup>But Jesus calling them to him, said: Suffer the little
children to come to me, and forbid them not; for to such belongs
the kingdom of God. <sup>17</sup>Verily I say to you, whoever shall
not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter
therein.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And a certain ruler asked him, saying:
Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
<sup>19</sup>And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good?
None is good save one, God. <sup>20</sup>Thou knowest the
commandments: <span class="ot">Do not commit adultery, Do not kill,
Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and thy
mother.</span> <sup>21</sup>And he said: All these I kept from my
youth. <sup>22</sup>And Jesus hearing it said to him: Yet lackest
thou one thing; sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
<sup>23</sup>And hearing this, he became very sorrowful; for he was
exceedingly rich. <sup>24</sup>And Jesus seeing him became very
sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into
the kingdom of God! <sup>25</sup>For it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God. <sup>26</sup>And they who heard it said: And who
can be saved? <sup>27</sup>And he said: The things that are
impossible with men are possible with God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And Peter said: Lo, we forsook all, and
followed thee. <sup>29</sup>And he said to them: Verily I say to
you, there is no one that forsook house, or parents, or brothers,
or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
<sup>30</sup>who shall not receive manifold more in this present
time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And taking with him the twelve, he said
to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things
written by the prophets for the Son of man shall be accomplished.
<sup>32</sup>For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be
mocked, and insulted, and spit upon, <sup>33</sup>and they will
scourge him, and put him to death; and on the third day he will
rise again. <sup>34</sup>And they understood none of these things;
and this saying was hidden from them, and they knew not the things
that were said.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And it came to pass, that as he came
near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the way-side,
begging. <sup>36</sup>And hearing a multitude passing by, he
inquired what this was. <sup>37</sup>And they told him, that Jesus
of Nazareth is passing by. <sup>38</sup>And he called aloud,
saying: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me. <sup>39</sup>And
they who went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace.
But he cried much the more: Son of David, have mercy on me.
<sup>40</sup>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought
to him. And when he was come near, he asked him,
<sup>41</sup>saying: What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he
said: Lord, that I may receive sight. <sup>42</sup>And Jesus said
to him: Receive sight; thy faith has made thee whole.
<sup>43</sup>And immediately he received sight, and followed him,
glorifying God. And all the people, seeing it, gave praise to
God.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> having
entered in, he was passing through Jericho. <sup>2</sup>And behold,
there was a man named Zaccheus, and he was a chief publican; and
this man was rich. <sup>3</sup>And he sought to see Jesus, who he
was; and he could not on account of the multitude, because he was
small in stature. <sup>4</sup>And running before, he climbed up
into a sycamore-tree to see him; because by that way he was to pass
through. <sup>5</sup>And Jesus, when he came to the place, looked
up and saw him, and said to him: Zaccheus, make haste and come
down; for to-day I must abide at thy house. <sup>6</sup>And he made
haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. <sup>7</sup>And
seeing it, they all murmured, saying that he went in to be a guest
with a sinner.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And Zaccheus stood up, and said to the
Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if
I took aught from any one by false accusation, I restore fourfold.
<sup>9</sup>And Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to
this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
<sup>10</sup>For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which
was lost.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And as they were hearing these things,
he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and
because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately
appear. <sup>12</sup>He said therefore: A certain nobleman went
into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
<sup>13</sup>And having called his ten servants, he gave them ten
pounds, and said to them: Traffic, till I come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>But his citizens hated him, and sent an
embassy after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over
us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And it came to pass, when he had
returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these
servants to be called to him, to whom he gave the money, that he
might know what each gained by trading. <sup>16</sup>And the first
came, saying: Lord, thy pound gained ten pounds. <sup>17</sup>And
he said to him: Well done, good servant; because thou wast faithful
in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And the second came, saying: Lord, thy
pound made five pounds. <sup>19</sup>And he said also to this man:
And be thou over five cities. <sup>20</sup>And another came,
saying: Lord, behold thy pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin.
<sup>21</sup>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man;
thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and reapest what thou
didst not sow. <sup>22</sup>And he says to him: Out of thy mouth
will I judge thee, wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an
austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did
not sow? <sup>23</sup>Why then didst thou not put my money into the
bank? and I, at my coming, should have required it with interest.
<sup>24</sup>And he said to those standing by: Take from him the
pound, and give it to him that has the ten pounds. <sup>25</sup>And
they said to him: Lord, he has ten pounds. <sup>26</sup>For I say
to you, that to every one that has shall be given; and from him
that has not, even what he has shall be taken away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>But those my enemies, who would not
that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before
me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And having spoken these things, he went
before, going up to Jerusalem. <sup>29</sup>And it came to pass, as
he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called Olivet,
that he sent forth two of his disciples, <sup>30</sup>saying: Go
into the opposite village, in which as ye are entering ye will find
a colt tied, whereon no man ever sat; loose and bring him.
<sup>31</sup>And if any one ask you, why do ye loose him? thus
shall ye say to him: Because the Lord has need of him.
<sup>32</sup>And they that were sent forth departed, and found even
as he said to them. <sup>33</sup>And as they were loosing the colt,
its owners said to them: Why loose ye the colt? <sup>34</sup>And
they said: The Lord has need of him. <sup>35</sup>And they brought
him to Jesus; and having cast their garments upon the colt, they
set Jesus thereon. <sup>36</sup>And as he went, they spread their
garments in the way. <sup>37</sup>And as he was drawing near, just
at the descent of the mount of the Olives, the whole multitude of
the disciples began to rejoice, and praise God with a loud voice
for all the miracles which they saw; <sup>38</sup>saying: Blessed
be the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and
glory in the highest!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And some of the Pharisees from the
multitude said to him: Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.
<sup>40</sup>And answering he said to them: I tell you that if
these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And when he came near, as he saw the
city, he wept over it, <sup>42</sup>saying: If even thou hadst
known, at least in this thy day, the things that belong to thy
peace! But now they are hidden from thine eyes. <sup>43</sup>For
days will come upon thee, that thine enemies will cast up a mound
about thee, and compass thee round, and shut thee in on every side,
<sup>44</sup>and will level thee with the ground, and thy children
within thee, and will not leave in thee one stone upon another;
because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>And entering into the temple, he began
to cast out those who sold; <sup>46</sup>saying to them: It is
written, <span class="ot">And my house shall be a house of prayer;
but ye made it a den of robbers.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>And he was teaching daily in the
temple; and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the
people were seeking to destroy him, <sup>48</sup>and could not find
what they might do; for all the people hung, listening, upon
him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> it came to
pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the
temple, and publishing the good news, that the chief priests and
the scribes came to him with the elders, <sup>2</sup>and spoke to
him, saying: Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? Or
who is he that gave thee this authority? <sup>3</sup>And he
answering said to them: I also will ask you one thing; and tell it
me. <sup>4</sup>John's immersion, was it from heaven, or from men?
<sup>5</sup>And they reasoned with themselves, saying: If we say,
From heaven, he will say, Why, then did ye not believe him?
<sup>6</sup>But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us;
for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. <sup>7</sup>And
they answered, that they knew not whence it was. <sup>8</sup>And
Jesus said to them: Neither do I say to you, by what authority I do
these things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And he began to speak to the people this
parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen,
and went abroad for a long time. <sup>10</sup>And at the season he
sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the
fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him
away empty. <sup>11</sup>And again he sent another servant; and him
also, having beaten and treated him shamefully, they sent away
empty. <sup>12</sup>And again he sent a third; and they wounded him
also, and cast him out.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And the lord of the vineyard said: What
shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps, seeing him, they
will reverence him. <sup>14</sup>But when the husbandmen saw him,
they reasoned among themselves, saying: This is the heir; come, let
us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours. <sup>15</sup>So
they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore
will the lord of the vineyard do to them? <sup>16</sup>He will come
and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.
And hearing it, they said: Far be it! <sup>17</sup>And he, looking
on them, said: What then is this that is written,</p>
<p class="pp2">The stone which the builders disallowed,</p>
<p class="pp2">The same is become the head of the corner.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Every one that falls upon that stone
shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him
to powder.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And the scribes and the chief priests
sought to lay hands on him in that hour; and they feared the
people; for they knew that he spoke this parable against them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And watching him<sup><a href="#r422020"
id="f422020" title="see footnote" name="f422020">20</a></sup>, they
sent forth spies, feigning themselves to be just men, that they
might take hold of his words, in order to deliver him up to the
magistracy, and to the authority of the governor. <sup>21</sup>And
they asked him, saying: Teacher, we know that thou sayest and
teachest rightly, and regardest not the person of any, but teachest
the way of God truly. <sup>22</sup>Is it lawful that we should give
tribute to C&aelig;sar, or not? <sup>23</sup>And perceiving their
craftiness, he said to them: <sup>24</sup>Show me a
den&aacute;ry<sup><a href="#r422024" id="f422024" title=
"see footnote" name="f422024">24</a></sup>. Whose image and
inscription has it? And answering they said: C&aelig;sar's.
<sup>25</sup>And he said to them: Render therefore to C&aelig;sar
the things that are C&aelig;sar's, and to God the things that are
God's. <sup>26</sup>And they could not take hold of his words
before the people; and they marveled at his answer, and held their
peace.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And some of the Sadducees, who deny
that there is a resurrection, coming to him, asked him,
<sup>28</sup>saying: Teacher, Moses wrote to us, if a man's brother
die, having a wife, and he die childless, that his brother should
take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>There were therefore seven brothers;
and the first took a wife, and died childless; <sup>30</sup>and the
second and the third took her; <sup>31</sup>and in like manner also
the seven left no children, and died. <sup>32</sup>At last the
woman also died. <sup>33</sup>In the resurrection, therefore, of
which of them is she wife? For the seven had her for a wife.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>And Jesus answering said to them: The
sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage.
<sup>35</sup>But they who are accounted worthy to obtain that
world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
given in marriage; <sup>36</sup>for neither can they die any more;
for they are equal to the angels, and are sons of God, being sons
of the resurrection.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>Now that the dead are raised, even
Moses showed, at The Bush, when he calls the Lord the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
<sup>38</sup>For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living;
for to him all live.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And some of the scribes answering said:
Teacher, thou saidst well. <sup>40</sup>For they no longer dared to
ask him any question.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And he said to them: How say they that
the Christ is son of David? <sup>42</sup>And David himself says in
the book of Psalms:</p>
<p class="pp3">The LORD said to my Lord,</p>
<p class="pp3">Sit on my right hand,</p>
<p class="pp3"><sup>43</sup>Till I make thine enemies thy
footstool.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>David therefore calls him Lord, and how
is he his son?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>And in the hearing of all the
multitude, he said to his disciples: <sup>46</sup>Beware of the
scribes, who desire to go about in long robes, and love greetings
in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the
first places at feasts; <sup>47</sup>who devour widows' houses, and
for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater
condemnation.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> looking
up, he saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
<sup>2</sup>And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither
two mites. <sup>3</sup>And he said: Of a truth I say to you, that
this poor widow cast in more than all. <sup>4</sup>For all these,
out of their abundance, cast into the offerings; but she, out of
her want, cast in all the living that she had.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And as some were saying of the temple,
that it has been adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he
said: <sup>6</sup>As for these things which ye behold, days will
come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that
shall not be thrown down. <sup>7</sup>And they asked him, saying:
Teacher, when therefore will these things be, and what will be the
sign when these things are about to come to pass?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And he said: Take heed that ye be not
led astray. For many will come in my name, saying: I am he, and the
time is at hand. Go not after them. <sup>9</sup>And when ye shall
hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified; for these things
must first come to pass; but the end is not immediately.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Then said he to them: Nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; <sup>11</sup>and there
will be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and
pestilences; and there will be great portents and signs from
heaven. <sup>12</sup>And before all these, they will lay their
hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up into synagogues
and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's
sake. <sup>13</sup>And it shall turn out to you for a
testimony.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Settle it therefore in your hearts, not
to meditate before what ye shall answer. <sup>15</sup>For I will
give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not
be able to gainsay or withstand. <sup>16</sup>And ye will be
delivered up both by parents, and brothers, and kindred, and
friends; and some of you they will cause to be put to death.
<sup>17</sup>And ye will be hated by all for my name's sake.

<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And when ye shall see Jerusalem
encompassed by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.
<sup>21</sup>Then let those in Jud&aelig;a flee into the mountains;
and let those in the midst of it depart out; and let those in the
fields not enter into it. <sup>22</sup>Because these are the days
of vengeance, that all the things which are written may be
fulfilled.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>Woe to those who are with child, and to
those who give suck, in those days! For there shall be great
distress upon the land, and wrath to this people. <sup>24</sup>And
they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away
captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down
by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles shall be
fulfilled.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And there shall be signs in the sun,
and moon, and stars; and on the earth distress of nations, in
perplexity for the roaring of the sea and waves; <sup>26</sup>men's
hearts failing them for fear, and for looking for those things that
are coming on the world; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
<sup>27</sup>And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a
cloud, with power and great glory. <sup>28</sup>And when these
things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads;
for your redemption is drawing nigh.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And he spoke to them a parable: Behold
the fig-tree, and all the trees. <sup>30</sup>When they already
shoot forth, seeing it ye know of yourselves that the summer is
already near. <sup>31</sup>So also ye, when ye see these things
coming to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near.
<sup>32</sup>Verily I say to you, this generation shall not pass
away, till all shall have come to pass. <sup>33</sup>Heaven and
earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>And take heed to yourselves, lest at
any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and
drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you
unawares. <sup>35</sup>For as a snare shall it come on all that
dwell on the face of the whole earth. <sup>36</sup>And watch, in
every time praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all
these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son
of man.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>And in the daytime he was teaching in
the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that
is called Olivet. <sup>38</sup>And all the people came early in the
morning to him in the temple, to hear him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> the feast
of unleavened bread was drawing near, which is called the Passover;
<sup>2</sup>and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how
they might kill him; for they feared the people.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And Satan entered into Judas called
Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. <sup>4</sup>And he
went away, and consulted with the chief priests and captains, how
he might deliver him up to them. <sup>5</sup>And they were glad,
and covenanted to give him money. <sup>6</sup>And he promised, and
sought opportunity to deliver him up to them in the absence of the
multitude.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And the day of unleavened bread came,
when the passover must be killed. <sup>8</sup>And he sent away
Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare us the passover, that we
may eat it. <sup>9</sup>And they said to him: Where wilt thou that
we prepare? <sup>10</sup>And he said to them: Behold, when ye have
entered into the city, there will meet you a man bearing a pitcher
of water; follow him into the house where he enters in.
<sup>11</sup>And ye shall say to the master of the house: The
Teacher says to thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I may eat
the passover with my disciples? <sup>12</sup>And he will show you a
large upper room furnished; there make ready. <sup>13</sup>And they
went away, and found as he had said to them. And they made ready
the passover.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And when the hour came, he reclined at
table, and the apostles with him. <sup>15</sup>And he said to them:
I earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.
<sup>16</sup>For I say to you, I shall eat of it no more, until it
be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. <sup>17</sup>And having
received a cup, he gave thanks and said: Take this, and divide it
among yourselves. <sup>18</sup>For I say to you, I will not drink
of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And taking a loaf, he gave thanks, and
broke it, and gave to them, saying: This is my body which is given
for you; this do in remembrance of me. <sup>20</sup>And the cup in
like manner after supper, saying: This cup is the new covenant in
my blood, which is shed for you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>But, behold, the hand of him that
betrays me is with me on the table. <sup>22</sup>For the Son of man
indeed goes, as it was determined; but woe to that man by whom he
is betrayed! <sup>23</sup>And they began to inquire among
themselves, who then it might be that should do this thing?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And there arose also a contention among
them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
<sup>25</sup>And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles
exercise lordship over them; and they who exercise authority over
them are called benefactors. <sup>26</sup>But ye are not so; but
let the greatest among you become as the younger, and he that is
chief as he that serves. <sup>27</sup>For which is greater, he that
reclines at table, or he that serves? Is not he that reclines at
table? But I am in the midst of you as he that serves.
<sup>28</sup>Ye are they who have continued with me in my
temptations; <sup>29</sup>and I appoint to you a kingdom, as my
Father appointed to me, <sup>30</sup>that ye may eat and drink at
my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones, judging the
twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And the Lord said: Simon, Simon,
behold, Satan asked for you, to sift as the wheat. <sup>32</sup>But
I prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and thou, when thou
hast turned, strengthen thy brethren.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And he said to him: Lord, I am ready to
go with thee, both to prison and to death. <sup>34</sup>And he
said: I say to thee, Peter, a cock will not crow this day, till
thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And he said to them: When I sent you
without purse, and bag, and sandals, lacked ye anything? And they
said: Nothing. <sup>36</sup>Therefore said he to them: But now, he
that has a purse let him take it, and likewise a bag; and he that
has not, let him sell his garment and buy a sword. <sup>37</sup>For
I say to you, that yet this which is written must be accomplished
in me: <span class="ot">And he was reckoned among
transgressors;</span> for the things concerning me have an
end<sup><a href="#r422237" id="f422237" title="see footnote" name=

<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And they said: Lord, behold, here are
two swords. And he said: It is enough!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And going out, he went as he was wont
to the mount of the Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
<sup>40</sup>And when he was at the place, he said to them: Pray
that ye enter not into temptation. <sup>41</sup>And he withdrew
from them about a stone's throw; and kneeling down, he prayed,
<sup>42</sup>saying: Father, if thou art willing to remove this cup
from me! Yet, not my will but thine be done.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>And there appeared to him an angel from
heaven, strengthening him. <sup>44</sup>And being in an agony he
prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops
of blood falling down to the ground. <sup>45</sup>And rising up
from prayer, and coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping,
from sorrow. <sup>46</sup>And he said to them: Why sleep ye? Arise
and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>While he was yet speaking, behold a
multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went
before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss him. <sup>48</sup>But
Jesus said to him: Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a
kiss? <sup>49</sup>And they who were about him, seeing what would
follow, said to him: Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
<sup>50</sup>And a certain one of them smote the servant of the
high priest, and took off his right ear. <sup>51</sup>And Jesus
answering said: Suffer thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>52</sup>And Jesus said to the chief priests and
captains of the temple and elders, who were come to him: Have ye
come out as against a robber, with swords and staves?
<sup>53</sup>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched
not forth your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the
power of darkness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>54</sup>And they took him, and led him away,
and brought him into the house of the high priest. And Peter
followed afar off.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>55</sup>And they having kindled a fire in the
midst of the court, and sat down together, Peter sat down among
them. <sup>56</sup>And a certain maid seeing him as he sat by the
fire, and looking intently upon him, said: This man also was with
him. <sup>57</sup>And he denied him, saying: Woman, I do not know
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>58</sup>And after a little while, another
seeing him said: Thou also art of them. And Peter said: Man, I am
not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>59</sup>And about the space of one hour after,
another confidently affirmed, saying: Of a truth this one also was
with him; for he is a Galil&aelig;an. <sup>60</sup>And Peter said:
Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet
speaking, a cock crowed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>61</sup>And the Lord turning looked upon Peter.
And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him:
Before a cock crows this day, thou wilt deny me thrice.
<sup>62</sup>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>63</sup>And the men who held Jesus mocked him,
beating him; <sup>64</sup>and having blindfolded him they asked
him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? <sup>65</sup>And
many other things they said, reviling him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>66</sup>And when it was day, the elders of the
people<sup><a href="#r422266" id="f422266" title="see footnote"
name="f422266">66</a></sup>, and the chief priests and scribes,
came together; and they brought him up into their council, saying:
<sup>67</sup>If thou art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them:
If I tell you, ye will not believe. <sup>68</sup>And if I ask, ye
will not answer. <sup>69</sup>But henceforth shall the Son of man
sit on the right hand of the power of God. <sup>70</sup>And they
all said: Art thou then the Son of God? And he said to them: Ye say
it; for I am. <sup>71</sup>And they said: Why need we any further
witness? For we ourselves heard it from his own mouth.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> the
whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
<sup>2</sup>And they began to accuse him, saying: We found this man
perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to
C&aelig;sar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.
<sup>3</sup>And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the King of the
Jews? And he answering said to him: Thou sayest it. <sup>4</sup>And
Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes: I find no
fault in this man. <sup>5</sup>And they were the more violent,
saying: He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all
Jud&aelig;a, beginning from Galilee, unto this place.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked
if the man is a Galil&aelig;an. <sup>7</sup>And learning that he
belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him up to Herod, who also
was himself in Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And Herod, when he saw Jesus, rejoiced
greatly; for he had desired for a long time to see him, because he
had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by
him. <sup>9</sup>And he questioned him in many words; but he
answered him nothing. <sup>10</sup>And the chief priests and
scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <sup>11</sup>And Herod with
his men of war set him at naught, and mocked him, and arraying him
in a gorgeous robe sent him back to Pilate. <sup>12</sup>And Pilate
and Herod on that day became friends with each other; for before
they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And Pilate, having called together the
chief priests and the rulers and the people, <sup>14</sup>said to
them: Ye brought to me this man, as one perverting the people; and,
behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this
man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him. <sup>15</sup>No,
nor yet Herod; for I sent you up to him; and behold, nothing worthy
of death has been done by him. <sup>16</sup>I will therefore
chastise, and release him. <sup>17</sup><sup><a href="#r422317" id=
"f422317" title="see footnote" name="f422317">17</a></sup>
<sup>18</sup>And they cried out all at once, saying: Away with this
man, and release to us Barabbas! <sup>19</sup>(who for a certain
sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into
prison.)</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Again, therefore, Pilate spoke to them,
desiring to release Jesus. <sup>21</sup>But they cried, saying:
Crucify, crucify him. <sup>22</sup>And a third time he said to
them: What evil then has this man done? I found no cause of death
in him. I will therefore chastise, and release him.
<sup>23</sup>And they were urgent with loud voices, requiring that
he should be crucified. And their voices and those of the chief
priests prevailed. <sup>24</sup>And Pilate gave sentence, that what
they required should be done. <sup>25</sup>And he released him who
for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they required;
but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And as they led him away, they laid
hold of one Simon a Cyrenian, coming from the country, and on him
they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
<sup>27</sup>And there followed him a great company of the people,
and of women who also bewailed and lamented him. <sup>28</sup>But
Jesus turning to them said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for
me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
<sup>29</sup>For, behold, days are coming in which they shall say:
Happy the barren, and wombs that never bore, and breasts that never
gave suck. <sup>30</sup>Then shall they begin to say to the
mountains: Fall on us; and to the hills: Cover us. <sup>31</sup>For
if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in
the dry?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And there were also two others,
malefactors, led with him to be put to death. <sup>33</sup>And when
they had gone away to the place which is called A Skull, there they
crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the
other on the left. <sup>34</sup>And Jesus said: Father, forgive
them; for they know not what they do. And they divided his
garments, casting lots.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And the people stood beholding. And the
rulers also scoffed, saying: Others he saved; let him save himself,
if he is the Christ, the chosen of God. <sup>36</sup>And the
soldiers also coming to him mocked him, offering him vinegar,
<sup>37</sup>and saying: If thou art the King of the Jews, save
thyself.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And there was an inscription written
over him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And one of the malefactors who were
hanged railed at him, saying: If thou art the Christ, save thyself
and us. <sup>40</sup>But the other answering rebuked him, saying:
Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same
condemnation? <sup>41</sup>And we indeed justly; for we are
receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man did nothing
amiss. <sup>42</sup>And he said to Jesus: Remember me, when thou
comest in thy kingdom. <sup>43</sup>And Jesus said to him: Verily I
say to thee, to-day thou shalt be with me in paradise.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>And it was about the sixth hour; and
darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
<sup>45</sup>And the sun was darkened; and the vail of the temple
was rent in the midst. <sup>46</sup>And Jesus, crying with a loud
voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having
said this, he expired.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>And the centurion, seeing what was
done, glorified God, saying: Verily, this man was righteous!
<sup>48</sup>And all the multitudes who had come together to that
sight, having beheld the things that were done, returned, beating
their breasts. <sup>49</sup>And all his acquaintance were standing
afar off, and women who had followed him from Galilee, beholding
these things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>50</sup>And, behold, a man named Joseph, a
counselor, a good and just man, <sup>51</sup>(he had not consented
to their counsel and deed), from Arimath&aelig;a a city of the
Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God, <sup>52</sup>this man
went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. <sup>53</sup>And
taking it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre
that was hewn in the rock, where no one was yet laid.
<sup>54</sup>And it was the day of preparation, and the sabbath
drew on. <sup>55</sup>And the women also, who had come with him out
of Galilee, followed after, and viewed the sepulchre, and how his
body was laid. <sup>56</sup>And returning, they prepared spices and
ointments; and on the sabbath they rested, according to the
commandment.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXIV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> on the
first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the
sepulchre, bringing the spices which they prepared. <sup>2</sup>And
they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
<sup>3</sup>And entering in, they found not the body of the Lord
Jesus. <sup>4</sup>And it came to pass, that as they were much
perplexed concerning this, behold two men stood by them in shining
garments. <sup>5</sup>And they being afraid and bowing their faces
to the earth, they said to them: Why seek ye the living among the
dead? <sup>6</sup>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he
spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee, <sup>7</sup>saying: The
Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be
crucified, and on the third day rise again. <sup>8</sup>And they
remembered his words.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And returning from the sepulchre, they
reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
<sup>10</sup>And it was Mary the Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary
the mother of James, and the other women with them, who said these
things to the apostles. <sup>11</sup>And their words seemed to them
as idle talk, and they believed them not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>But Peter rose up, and ran to the
sepulchre; and stooping down, he beholds the linen cloths lying by
themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which
was come to pass.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And, behold, two of them were going on
that same day to a village called Emmaus, distant sixty furlongs
from Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>And they were conversing together
concerning all these things that had taken place. <sup>15</sup>And
it came to pass, that while they were conversing and reasoning,
Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. <sup>16</sup>But their
eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And he said to them: What
communications are these, that ye have one with another, as ye
walk, and are sad? <sup>18</sup>And one, whose name was Cleopas,
answering said to him: Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not
know the things that have come to pass there in these days?
<sup>19</sup>And he said to them: What things? And they said to
him: The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet
mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;
<sup>20</sup>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him
up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <sup>21</sup>But we
were hoping that it was he who was to redeem Israel. But indeed,
beside all this, to-day is the third day since these things were
done. <sup>22</sup>Yea, and certain women also of our company made
us astonished, who were early at the sepulchre; <sup>23</sup>and
not finding his body, came saying, that they had also seen a vision
of angels, who say that he is alive. <sup>24</sup>And some of those
who were with us went away to the sepulchre, and found it even so
as the women said; but him they saw not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Then he said to them: O foolish, and
slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
<sup>26</sup>Was it not necessary, that the Christ should suffer
these things, and enter into his glory? <sup>27</sup>And beginning
from Moses, and all the prophets, he explained to them in all the
Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And they drew near to the village,
whither they were going; and he made as though he would go further.
<sup>29</sup>But they constrained him, saying: Abide with us; for
it is toward evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to
abide with them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And it came to pass, that as he was
reclining at table with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and
breaking, gave to them. <sup>31</sup>And their eyes were opened,
and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
<sup>32</sup>And they said one to another: Did not our heart burn
within us, while he talked to us in the way, and while he opened to
us the Scriptures?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And rising up in the same hour, they
returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and those who were
with them gathered together, <sup>34</sup>saying: The Lord is risen
indeed, and he appeared to Simon. <sup>35</sup>And they related
what things were done in the way, and how he became known by them
in the breaking of bread.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And while they were speaking these
things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them:
Peace be to you. <sup>37</sup>But they were terrified and
affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.
<sup>38</sup>And he said to them: Why are ye troubled? And
wherefore do thoughts arise in your hearts? <sup>39</sup>See my
hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me, and see; for a
spirit has not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. <sup>40</sup>And
having said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
<sup>41</sup>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered,
he said to them: Have ye here anything to eat? <sup>42</sup>And
they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb.
<sup>43</sup>And he took, and ate it before them. <sup>44</sup>And
he said to them: These are my words which I spoke to you, while I
was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which are
written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and psalms,
concerning me. <sup>45</sup>Then he opened their understanding,
that they might understand the Scriptures. <sup>46</sup>And he said
to them: Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and
should rise from the dead on the third day; <sup>47</sup>and that
repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name
among all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <sup>48</sup>Ye are
witnesses of these things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>49</sup>And, behold, I send forth the promise
of my Father upon you. But do ye tarry in the city, until ye are
endued with power from on high.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>50</sup>And he led them out as far as to
Bethany; and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.
<sup>51</sup>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, that he
parted from them, and was borne up into heaven. <sup>52</sup>And
they, having worshiped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy;
<sup>53</sup>and were continually in the temple, praising and
blessing God.</p>

been made. <sup>4</sup>In him was life; and the life was the light
of men. <sup>5</sup>And the light shines in the darkness; and the
darkness comprehended it not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>There was a man sent from God, whose
name was John. <sup>7</sup>The same came for witness, to bear
witness of the light, that through him all might believe.
<sup>8</sup>He was not the light; but [came] to bear witness of the
light. <sup>9</sup>There was the true light, which lights every man
that comes into the world. <sup>10</sup>He was in the world, and
the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
<sup>11</sup>He came to his own, and his own received him not.
<sup>12</sup>But as many as received him, to them he gave power to
become children of God, to those who believe on his name;
<sup>13</sup>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the
flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt

the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>John bore witness of him; and cried,
saying: This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is

all received, and grace for grace. <sup>17</sup>For the law was
given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
<sup>18</sup>No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who
is in the bosom of the Father, he declared him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And this is the witness of John, when
the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: Who
art thou? <sup>20</sup>And he confessed, and denied not; and he
confessed: I am not the Christ. <sup>21</sup>And they asked him:
What then? Art thou Elijah? And he says: I am not. Art thou the
Prophet? And he answered: No. <sup>22</sup>They said therefore to
him: Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us.
What sayest thou of thyself? <sup>23</sup>He said: I am the voice
of one crying in the wilderness: <span class="ot">Make straight the
way of the Lord</span>, as said Isaiah the prophet.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And they who were sent were of the
Pharisees. <sup>25</sup>And they asked him, and said to him: Why
then dost thou immerse, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor
the Prophet? <sup>26</sup>John answered them, saying: I immerse in
water. There stands one in the midst of you, whom ye know not;
<sup>27</sup>he who comes after me, the latchet of whose sandal I
am not worthy to loose.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>These things took place in Bethany
beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>On the morrow, he sees Jesus coming to
him, and says: Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of
the world! <sup>30</sup>This is he of whom I said: After me comes a
man who is preferred before me; because he was before
me<sup><a href="#r430130" id="f430130" title="see footnote" name=
"f430130">30</a></sup>. <sup>31</sup>And I knew him not; but that
he might be made manifest to Israel, for this I came immersing in
water.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And John bore witness, saying: I have
seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and it abode
upon him. <sup>33</sup>And I knew him not; but he who sent me to
immerse in water, the same said to me: Upon whom thou shalt see the
Spirit descending, and abiding on him, the same is he who immerses
in the Holy Spirit. <sup>34</sup>And I have seen, and have borne
witness, that this is the Son of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>Again, on the morrow, John was
standing, and two of his disciples; <sup>36</sup>and looking upon
Jesus as he walked, he says: Behold the Lamb of God!
<sup>37</sup>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they
followed Jesus. <sup>38</sup>And Jesus turning, and beholding them
following, says to them: What seek ye? They said to him: Rabbi
(which interpreted means, Teacher), where dost thou abide?
<sup>39</sup>He says to them: Come, and ye shall see. They came and
saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about
the tenth hour.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was
one of the two who heard it from John, and followed him.
<sup>41</sup>He first finds his brother Simon, and says to him: We
have found the Messiah, which is interpreted, Christ.
<sup>42</sup>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus, beholding him,
said: Thou art Simon the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas,
which is interpreted, Peter<sup><a href="#r430142" id="f430142"
title="see footnote" name="f430142">42</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>On the morrow he would go forth into
Galilee. And he finds Philip; and Jesus says to him: Follow me.
<sup>44</sup>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew
and Peter. <sup>45</sup>Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him: We
have found him of whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets wrote,
Jesus the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth. <sup>46</sup>And
Nathanael said to him: Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?
Philip says to him: Come and see. <sup>47</sup>Jesus saw Nathanael
coming to him, and says of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom
is no guile! <sup>48</sup>Nathanael says to him: Whence knowest
thou me? Jesus answered and said to him: Before Philip called thee,
when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.
<sup>49</sup>Nathanael answered: Rabbi; thou art the Son of God,
thou art the King of Israel. <sup>50</sup>Jesus answered and said
to him: Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree,
believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.
<sup>51</sup>And he says to him: Verily, verily, I say to you,
henceforth<sup><a href="#r430151" id="f430151" title="see footnote"

angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother
of Jesus was there. <sup>2</sup>And Jesus also was bidden, and his
disciples, to the marriage. <sup>3</sup>And wine having failed, the
mother of Jesus says to him: They have no wine. <sup>4</sup>Jesus
says to her: Woman, what have I to do with thee? My hour is not yet
come. <sup>5</sup>His mother says to the servants: Whatever he says
to you, do it. <sup>6</sup>Now there were set there six water-pots
of stone, after the Jewish custom of purifying, containing two or
three firkins<sup><a href="#r430206" id="f430206" title=
"see footnote" name="f430206">6</a></sup> apiece. <sup>7</sup>Jesus
says to them: Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them
up to the brim. <sup>8</sup>And he says to them: Draw out now, and
bear to the ruler of the feast. And they bore it. <sup>9</sup>When
the ruler of the feast tasted the water that was made wine (and he
knew not whence it was, but the servants who had drawn the water
knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
<sup>10</sup>and says to him: Every man sets forth the good wine
first; and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse.
Thou hast kept the good wine until now. <sup>11</sup>This beginning
of the signs Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his
glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>After this he went down to Capernaum,
he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; and they
abode there not many days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And the passover of the Jews was at
hand; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>And he found in
the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the
money-changers sitting. <sup>15</sup>And having made a scourge of
small cords, he drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the
oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
<sup>16</sup>and to those who sold doves he said: Take these things
hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.
<sup>17</sup>And his disciples remembered that it is written:
<span class="ot">for thy house consumes me.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>The Jews therefore answered and said to
him: What sign dost thou show to us, seeing that thou doest these
things? <sup>19</sup>Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this
temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
<sup>20</sup>Therefore said the Jews: Forty and six years was this
temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?
<sup>21</sup>But he said it of the temple of his body.
<sup>22</sup>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his
disciples remembered that he said this; and they believed the
Scripture, and the word which Jesus spoke.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And when he was in Jerusalem at the
passover, on the feast-day, many believed on his name, beholding
his signs which he wrought. <sup>24</sup>But Jesus did not trust
himself to them, because he knew all men, <sup>25</sup>and had no
need that any one should testify of man; for he himself knew what
was in man.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">here</span> was a
man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
<sup>2</sup>The same came to him by night, and said to him: Rabbi,
we know that thou hast come a teacher from God; for no one can do
these signs which thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Jesus answered and said to him: Verily,
verily, I say to thee, except a man be born again<sup><a href=
"#r430303" id="f430303" title="see footnote" name=
"f430303">3</a></sup>, he can not see the kingdom of God.
<sup>4</sup>Nicodemus says to him: How can a man be born when he is
old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be
born?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Jesus answered: Verily, verily, I say to
thee, except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he can not
enter into the kingdom of God. <sup>6</sup>That which is born of
the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
<sup>7</sup>Marvel not that I said to thee: Ye must be born
again.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>The wind blows where it will, and thou
hearest the sound thereof, but knowest not whence it comes, and
whither it goes. So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Nicodemus answered and said to him: How
can these things be? <sup>10</sup>Jesus answered and said to him:
Art thou the teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?
<sup>11</sup>Verily, verily, I say to thee, we speak that which we
know, and testify that which we have seen; and ye receive not our
testimony. <sup>12</sup>If I told you the earthly things, and ye
believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you the heavenly
things? <sup>13</sup>And no one has ascended up into heaven, but he
who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.
<sup>14</sup>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
so must the Son of man be lifted up; <sup>15</sup>that every one
who believes on him may have everlasting life. <sup>16</sup>For God
so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that
whoever believes on him, should not perish, but may have
everlasting life. <sup>17</sup>For God sent not his Son into the
world to judge the world; but that the world through him might be
saved. <sup>18</sup>He that believes on him is not judged; but he
that believes not has already been judged, because he has not
believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
<sup>19</sup>And this is the judgment, that light has come into the
world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their
deeds were evil. <sup>20</sup>For every one that does evil hates
the light, and comes not to the light, lest his deeds should be
reproved. <sup>21</sup>But he that does the truth comes to the
light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought
in God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>After these things came Jesus and his
disciples into the land of Jud&aelig;a; and there he remained with
them, and immersed. <sup>23</sup>And John also was immersing in
&AElig;non near to Salim, because there was much water there; and
they came, and were immersed. <sup>24</sup>For John was not yet
cast into prison.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>There arose therefore a question, on
the part of John's disciples with a Jew, about purification.
<sup>26</sup>And they came to John and said to him: Rabbi, he who
was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness,
behold, he immerses, and all come to him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>John answered and said: A man can
receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
<sup>28</sup>Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not
the Christ, but I am sent before him. <sup>29</sup>He that has the
bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who
stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's
voice. This my joy therefore is made full. <sup>30</sup>He must
increase, but I must decrease. <sup>31</sup>He that comes from
above is above all; he that is from the earth is of the earth, and
speaks of the earth; he that comes from heaven is above all.
<sup>32</sup>And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and
his testimony no one receives. <sup>33</sup>He that received his
testimony has set his seal, That God is true. <sup>34</sup>For he
whom God sent forth speaks the words of God; for he gives
not<sup><a href="#r430334" id="f430334" title="see footnote" name=
"f430334">34</a></sup> the Spirit by measure. <sup>35</sup>The
Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
<sup>36</sup>He that believes on the Son has everlasting life; and
he that believes not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of
God abides on him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">hen</span> therefore
the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard, that Jesus made and
immersed more disciples than John <sup>2</sup>(though Jesus himself
immersed not, but his disciples), <sup>3</sup>he left Jud&aelig;a,
and departed again into Galilee. <sup>4</sup>And he must go through
Samaria. <sup>5</sup>He comes therefore to a city of Samaria,
called Sychar<sup><a href="#r430405" id="f430405" title=
"see footnote" name="f430405">5</a></sup>, near to the parcel of
ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. <sup>6</sup>And Jacob's
well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with the journey,
sat down thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>There comes a woman of Samaria to draw
water. Jesus, says to her: Give me to drink. <sup>8</sup>For his
disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. <sup>9</sup>The
Samaritan woman therefore says to him: How is it that thou, being a
Jew, askest drink of me, being a Samaritan woman? For Jews do not
associate with Samaritans. <sup>10</sup>Jesus answered and said to
her: If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to
thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he
would have given thee living water. <sup>11</sup>The woman says to
him: Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.
From whence then hast thou the living water. <sup>12</sup>Art thou
greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank
thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
<sup>13</sup>Jesus answered and said to her: Every one that drinks
of this water shall thirst again. <sup>14</sup>But whoever drinks
of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the
water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water,
springing up into everlasting life. <sup>15</sup>The woman says to
him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come
hither to draw.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Jesus says to her: Go, call thy
husband, and come hither. <sup>17</sup>The woman answered and said:
I have no husband. Jesus says to her: Thou saidst well, I have no
husband. <sup>18</sup>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom
thou now hast is not thy husband. That thou hast spoken truly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>The woman says to him: Sir, I perceive
that thou art a prophet. <sup>20</sup>Our fathers worshiped in this
mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men
ought to worship. <sup>21</sup>Jesus says to her: Woman, believe
me, an hour is coming, when ye shall neither in this mountain nor
in Jerusalem worship the Father. <sup>22</sup>Ye worship that which
ye know not; we worship that which we know; because salvation is of
the Jews. <sup>23</sup>But an hour is coming, and now is, when the
true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth;
for such the Father seeks to worship him. <sup>24</sup>God is
spirit; and they that worship him, must worship in spirit and in
truth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>The woman says to him: I know that
Messiah comes (who is called Christ); when he is come, he will tell
us all things. <sup>26</sup>Jesus says to her: I that speak to thee
am he. <sup>27</sup>And upon this came his disciples; and they
marveled that he talked with the woman<sup><a href="#r430427" id=
"f430427" title="see footnote" name="f430427">27</a></sup>. Yet no
one said: What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
<sup>28</sup>The woman then left her water-pot, and went away into
the city; and she says to the men: <sup>29</sup>Come, see a man who
told me all things that ever I did. Is this the Christ?
<sup>30</sup>Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>In the mean while the disciples prayed
him, saying: Master, eat. <sup>32</sup>But he said to them: I have
food to eat that ye know not of. <sup>33</sup>Therefore said the
disciples one to another: Has any one brought him aught to eat?
<sup>34</sup>Jesus says to them: My food is to do the will of him
who sent me, and to finish his work. <sup>35</sup>Do ye not say,
that there are yet four months, and then comes the harvest? Behold,
I say to you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that they
are already white for harvest. <sup>36</sup>And he that reaps
receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal; that both he
that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together. <sup>37</sup>And
herein is the true saying: One sows, and another reaps.
<sup>38</sup>I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored.
Other men have labored, and ye have entered into their labor.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And many of the Samaritans of that city
believed on him for the saying of the woman, who testified: He told
me all that ever I did. <sup>40</sup>When therefore the Samaritans
came to him, they besought him to remain with them. And he remained
there two days. <sup>41</sup>And far more believed because of his
word; <sup>42</sup>and said to the woman: We no longer believe
because of thy saying; for we ourselves have heard, and know that
this is in truth the Savior of the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>And after the two days he departed
thence, and went into Galilee. <sup>44</sup>For Jesus himself
testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>When therefore he came into Galilee,
the Galil&aelig;ans received him, having seen all that he did in
Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.
<sup>46</sup>So he came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made
the water wine.</p>
<p class="pin">And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was
sick, in Capernaum. <sup>47</sup>He, having heard that Jesus is
come out of Jud&aelig;a into Galilee, went to him, and besought him
that he would come down and heal his son; for he was about to die.
<sup>48</sup>Jesus therefore said to him: Except ye see signs and
wonders, ye will not believe. <sup>49</sup>The nobleman says to
him: Sir, come down ere my child die. <sup>50</sup>Jesus says to
him: Go thy way; thy son lives. And the man believed the word that
Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. <sup>51</sup>And as he was
now going down, his servants met him, and brought word saying: Thy
child lives. <sup>52</sup>He inquired of them, therefore, the hour
when he began to amend. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the
seventh hour, the fever left him. <sup>53</sup>The father knew,
therefore, that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him:
Thy son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole house.
<sup>54</sup>This second sign Jesus wrought, when he had come out
of Jud&aelig;a into Galilee.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=
"sc">fter</span> these things there was a feast of the Jews; and
Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <sup>2</sup>And there is in Jerusalem
by the sheep-gate a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue
Bethesda, having five porches. <sup>3</sup>In these lay a multitude
of the infirm, of blind, lame, withered [waiting for the moving of
the water. <sup>4</sup>For an angel went down at a certain season
into the pool, and troubled the water. He therefore; who first went
in after the troubling of the water, was made whole of whatever
disease he had]<sup><a href="#r430504" id="f430504" title=
"see footnote" name="f430504">4</a></sup>. <sup>5</sup>And a
certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
<sup>6</sup>Jesus seeing this man lying, and knowing that he had
been already a long time thus, says to him: Dost thou desire to be
made whole? <sup>7</sup>The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no
man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while
I am coming, another goes down before me. <sup>8</sup>Jesus says to
him: Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. <sup>9</sup>And immediately
the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked.</p>
<p class="pin">And on that day was the sabbath. <sup>10</sup>The
Jews therefore said to him that was cured: It is the sabbath; it is
not lawful for thee to carry the bed. <sup>11</sup>He answered
them: He who made me whole, the same said to me: Take up thy bed,
and walk. <sup>12</sup>They asked him therefore: Who is the man
that said to thee: Take up thy bed and walk? <sup>13</sup>And he
who was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus conveyed himself
away, there being a multitude in the place.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Afterward Jesus finds him in the
temple. And he said to him: Behold, thou hast been made whole; sin
no more, lest something worse befall thee. <sup>15</sup>The man
departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who made him whole.
<sup>16</sup>And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did
these things on the sabbath. <sup>17</sup>But Jesus answered them:
My Father works hitherto, and I work. <sup>18</sup>For this
therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only
broke the sabbath, but also called God his Father, making himself
equal with God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Jesus therefore, answered and said to
them: Verily, verily, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of
himself, but what he sees the Father do; for what things soever he
does, these also does the Son in like manner. <sup>20</sup>For the
Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself
does; and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may
marvel. <sup>21</sup>For as the Father raises up the dead, and
quickens them; so also the Son quickens whom he will.
<sup>22</sup>For neither does the Father judge any one; but all
judgment he has given to the Son; <sup>23</sup>that all may honor
the Son, as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son,
honors not the Father who sent him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Verily, verily, I say to you, he that
hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has everlasting life,
and comes not into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
<sup>25</sup>Verily, verily, I say to you, an hour is coming, and
now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and
they that hear shall live. <sup>26</sup>For as the Father has life
in himself, so he gave also to the Son to have life in himself.
<sup>27</sup>And he gave him authority to execute judgment also,
because he is a son of man. <sup>28</sup>Marvel not at this; for an
hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his
voice, <sup>29</sup>and shall come forth; they that did good, to
the resurrection of life, and they that did evil, to the
resurrection of judgment.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>I can of myself do nothing. As I hear,
I judge; and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will,
but the will of him who sent me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>If I bear witness of myself, my witness
is not true. <sup>32</sup>There is another that bears witness of
me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
<sup>33</sup>Ye have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the
truth. <sup>34</sup>But I receive the witness not from man; but
these things I say, that ye might be saved. <sup>35</sup>He was the
burning and shining lamp; and ye were willing for a season to
rejoice in his light. <sup>36</sup>But I have greater witness than
that of John; for the works which the Father gave me to finish, the
works themselves that I do bear witness of me, that the Father has
sent me. <sup>37</sup>And the Father, who sent me, he has borne
witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor
have ye seen his shape. <sup>38</sup>And ye have not his word

things Jesus went away, beyond the sea of Galilee, which is the sea
of Tiberias. <sup>2</sup>And a great multitude followed him,
because they saw the signs which he wrought on the sick.
<sup>3</sup>And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat
with his disciples. <sup>4</sup>And the passover, the feast of the
Jews, was near. <sup>5</sup>Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes,
and seeing that a great multitude is coming to him, says to Philip:
Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat? <sup>6</sup>And this
he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was about to do.
<sup>7</sup>Philip answered him: Two hundred den&aacute;ries worth
of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a
little. <sup>8</sup>One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of
Simon Peter, says to him: <sup>9</sup>There is a lad here, who has
five barley loaves and two small fishes; but what are they among so
many? <sup>10</sup>Jesus said: Make the men lie down. Now there was
much grass in the place. So the men lay down, in number about five
thousand. <sup>11</sup>And Jesus took the loaves; and having given
thanks, he distributed to those who were lying down; and likewise
of the fishes as much as they desired. <sup>12</sup>When they were
filled, he said to his disciples: Gather up the fragments that
remain, that nothing be lost. <sup>13</sup>Therefore they gathered
them together, and filled twelve baskets with fragments of the five
barley loaves, which remained over and above to those who had
eaten. <sup>14</sup>The men therefore, seeing the sign that Jesus
wrought, said: This is of a truth the Prophet that comes into the
world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Jesus therefore, knowing that they were
about to come and take him by force, to make him a king, withdrew
again into the mountain, himself alone. <sup>16</sup>And when
evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, <sup>17</sup>and
entering into the ship, were going over the sea to Capernaum. And
it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them; <sup>18</sup>and
as a strong wind was blowing, the sea began to rise.
<sup>19</sup>When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or
thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing
near to the ship; and they were afraid. <sup>20</sup>But he says to
them: It is I, be not afraid. <sup>21</sup>They therefore willingly
received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the
land whither they were going.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>On the morrow, the multitude that stood
on the other side of the sea, seeing that there was no other boat
there but one, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the
ship, but his disciples went away alone <sup>23</sup>(but there
came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate
bread, when the Lord had given thanks); <sup>24</sup>when therefore
the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they
themselves entered into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking
for Jesus. <sup>25</sup>And having found him on the other side of
the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
<sup>26</sup>Jesus answered them and said: Verily, verily, I say to
you, ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of
the loaves and were filled. <sup>27</sup>Work not for the food that
perishes, but for the food that endures unto everlasting life,
which the Son of man will give to you; for him the Father, God, has
sealed, <sup>28</sup>Therefore they said to him: What shall we do,
that we may work the works of God? <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered and
said to them: This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom
he sent. <sup>30</sup>They therefore said to him: What sign doest
thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? What dost thou work?
<sup>31</sup>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is
written: <span class="ot">He gave them bread from heaven to
eat.</span> <sup>32</sup>Jesus therefore said to them: Verily,
verily, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread from
heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
<sup>33</sup>For the bread of God is that which<sup><a href=
"#r430633" id="f430633" title="see footnote" name=
"f430633">33</a></sup> comes down out of heaven, and gives life to
the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>They therefore said to him: Lord,
evermore give us this bread. <sup>35</sup>Jesus said to them: I am
the bread of life. He that comes to me shall never hunger, and he
that believes on me shall never thirst. <sup>36</sup>But I said to
you, that ye have also seen me, and do not believe.
<sup>37</sup>All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him
that comes to me I will not cast out. <sup>38</sup>Because I have
come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him
who sent me. <sup>39</sup>And this is the will of him who sent me,
that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should
raise it up at the last day. <sup>40</sup>For this is the will of
my Father, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him,
may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last
day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>The Jews therefore murmured at him,
because he said: I am the bread that came down out of heaven.
<sup>42</sup>And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph,
whose father and mother we know? How then does this man say: I have
come down out of heaven?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>Jesus answered and said to them: Murmur
not among yourselves. <sup>44</sup>No one can come to me, except
the Father who sent me draw him; and I will raise him up at the
last day. <sup>45</sup>It is written in the prophets: <span class=
"ot">And they shall all be taught of God.</span> Every one that has
heard from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.
<sup>46</sup>Not that any one has seen the Father, save he who is
from God; he has seen the Father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>Verily, verily, I say to you, he that
believes on me has everlasting life. <sup>48</sup>I am the bread of
life. <sup>49</sup>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness,
and are dead. <sup>50</sup>This is the bread that comes down out of
heaven, that one may eat thereof, and not die. <sup>51</sup>I am
the living bread that came down out of heaven. If any one eat of
this bread, he shall live forever; yea, and the bread that I will
give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>52</sup>The Jews therefore contended with one
another, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
<sup>53</sup>Jesus therefore said to them: Verily, verily, I say to
you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
blood, ye have no life in you. <sup>54</sup>He that eats my flesh,
and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at
the last day. <sup>55</sup>For my flesh is true food, and my blood
is true drink. <sup>56</sup>He that eats my flesh, and drinks my
blood, abides in me, and I in him. <sup>57</sup>As the living
Father has sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that
eats me, he also shall live because of me. <sup>58</sup>This is the
bread that came down out of heaven. Not as your fathers ate the
manna, and are dead; he that eats of this bread shall live
forever.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>59</sup>These things he said in the synagogue,
while teaching in Capernaum.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>60</sup>Many therefore of his disciples, when
they heard it, said: This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
<sup>61</sup>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples
murmured at this, said to them: Does this offend you?
<sup>62</sup>What then if ye behold the Son of man ascending up
where he was before? <sup>63</sup>It is the spirit that makes
alive, the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to
you are spirit, and are life. <sup>64</sup>But there are some of
you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they
were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him.
<sup>65</sup>And he said: For this cause I have said to you, that
no one can come to me, except it be given him from the Father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>66</sup>From this time many of his disciples
went back, and walked no more with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>67</sup>Jesus said therefore to the twelve:
Will ye also go away? <sup>68</sup>Simon Peter answered him: Lord,
to whom shall we go? Thou hast words of eternal life.
<sup>69</sup>And we believe and know, that thou art the Holy One of
God. <sup>70</sup>Jesus answered them: Did I not choose you, the
twelve, and one of you is a devil? <sup>71</sup>He spoke of Judas
Iscariot, son of Simon; for he it was that would betray him, being
one of the twelve.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> after
these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in
Jud&aelig;a, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of
tabernacles, was at hand. <sup>3</sup>His brothers therefore said
to him: Depart hence, and go into Jud&aelig;a, that thy disciples
also may behold thy works that thou doest. <sup>4</sup>For no one
does anything in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly.
If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.
<sup>5</sup>For neither did his brothers believe on him.
<sup>6</sup>Jesus therefore says to them: My time is not yet come;
but your time is always ready. <sup>7</sup>The world can not hate
you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are
evil. <sup>8</sup>Go ye up to the feast. I go not up to this feast;
because my time is not yet fully come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Having said these things to them, he
remained in Galilee. <sup>10</sup>But when his brothers were gone
up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but as it were
in secret.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>The Jews therefore sought him at the
feast, and said: Where is he? <sup>12</sup>And there was much
murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said: He is a
good man; others said: Nay, but he misleads the multitude.
<sup>13</sup>No one, however, spoke openly of him, for fear of the
Jews.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>But when it was already the midst of
the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
<sup>15</sup>And the Jews wondered, saying: How knows this man
letters, having never learned? <sup>16</sup>Jesus therefore
answered them, and said: My teaching is not mine, but his who sent
me. <sup>17</sup>If any one desires to do his will, he shall know
of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from
myself. <sup>18</sup>He that speaks from himself seeks his own
glory; but he that seeks the glory of him who sent him, the same is
true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Has not Moses given you the law, and
none of you keeps the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?
<sup>20</sup>The multitude answered and said: Thou hast a demon;
who seeks to kill thee? <sup>21</sup>Jesus answered and said to
them: I did one work, and ye all marvel. <sup>22</sup>Moses has for
this cause given you circumcision, not that it is of Moses, but of
the fathers; and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.
<sup>23</sup>If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath, that
the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I
made a man altogether whole on the sabbath? <sup>24</sup>Judge not
according to appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Then said some of those of Jerusalem:
Is not this he whom they seek to kill? <sup>26</sup>But, lo, he
speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Did the rulers
know<sup><a href="#r430726" id="f430726" title="see footnote" name=
"f430726">26</a></sup> in truth that this is the Christ?
<sup>27</sup>But we know this man, whence he is; but when the
Christ comes, no one knows whence he is.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Jesus therefore cried, teaching in the
temple and saying: Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am; and I
have not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know
not. <sup>29</sup>I know him; because I am from him, and he sent
me. <sup>30</sup>Therefore they sought to seize him; and no one
laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>But of the multitude many believed on
him, and said: When the Christ comes, will he work more signs than
these which this man wrought? <sup>32</sup>The Pharisees heard the
multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief
priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize him.
<sup>33</sup>Jesus therefore said: Yet a little while I am with
you, and I go to him who sent me. <sup>34</sup>Ye will seek me, and
shall not find me; and where I am, ye can not come.
<sup>35</sup>The Jews said therefore among themselves: Whither will
this man go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to those
dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <sup>36</sup>What
is this saying that he said: Ye will seek me, and shall not find
me; and where I am, ye can not come?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>In the last day, the great day of the
feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any one thirst, let him
come to me and drink. <sup>38</sup>He that believes on me, as said
the Scripture, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
<sup>39</sup>And this he spoke concerning the Spirit, which they
that believe on him should receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet
[given], because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>Some of the multitude therefore,
hearing the words, said: Of a truth this is the Prophet.
<sup>41</sup>Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Does
the Christ then come out of Galilee? <sup>42</sup>Did not the
Scripture say, that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from
the town of Bethlehem, where David was? <sup>43</sup>A division
therefore arose among the multitude because of him.
<sup>44</sup>And some of them desired to seize him; but no one laid
hands on him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>The officers therefore came to the
chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them: Why did ye not
bring him? <sup>46</sup>The officers answered: Never man spoke like
this man<sup><a href="#r430747" id="f430747" title="see footnote"
name="f430747">47</a></sup>. <sup>47</sup>The Pharisees answered
them: Are ye also led astray? <sup>48</sup>Did any of the rulers
believe on him, or of the Pharisees? <sup>49</sup>But this
multitude, that know not the law, are accursed.
<sup>50</sup>Nicodemus says to them (he who came to him by night,
being one of them): <sup>51</sup>Does our law judge a man, except
it first hear from him, and know what he does? <sup>52</sup>They
answered and said to him: Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and
see, that out of Galilee arises no prophet<sup><a href="#r430752"
id="f430752" title="see footnote" name="f430752">52</a></sup>.
<sup>53</sup><sup><a href="#r430753" id="f430753" title=

house.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;J<span class="sc">esus</span> went to
the mount of the Olives.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And early in the morning he came again
into the temple, and all the people came to him; and having sat
down, he was teaching them. <sup>3</sup>And the scribes and the
Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery; and having placed
her in the midst, <sup>4</sup>they say to him: Teacher, this woman
was taken in adultery, in the very act: <sup>5</sup>Now in the law
Moses commanded us, that such should be stoned; what then dost thou
say? <sup>6</sup>This they said, tempting him, that they might have
whereof to accuse him. But Jesus, having stooped down, was writing
with his finger in the ground. <sup>7</sup>And as they continued
asking him, raising himself up, he said to them: He that is without
sin among you, let him first cast the stone at her. <sup>8</sup>And
again stooping down, he wrote in the ground. <sup>9</sup>And they
hearing it, and being convicted by their conscience, went out one
by one, beginning at the eldest, unto the last; and Jesus was left
alone, and the woman standing in the midst. <sup>10</sup>And Jesus
raising himself up, and seeing none but the woman, said to her:
Woman, where are they, thine accusers? Did no one condemn thee?
<sup>11</sup>She said: No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her: Neither
do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more.]</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Again therefore Jesus spoke to them,
saying: I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not
walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.
<sup>13</sup>The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou bearest
witness of thyself; thy witness is not true. <sup>14</sup>Jesus
answered and said to them: Though I bear witness of myself, my
witness is true; because I know whence I came, and whither I go;
but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go. <sup>15</sup>Ye
judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. <sup>16</sup>And even
if I judge, my judgment is true; because I am not alone, but I and
the Father who sent me. <sup>17</sup>It is written also in your
law, that the witness of two men is true. <sup>18</sup>I am one
that bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears
witness of me. <sup>19</sup>They said therefore to him: Where is
thy Father? Jesus answered: Ye know neither me, nor my Father. If
ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>These words he spoke in the treasury,
while teaching in the temple; and no one laid hands on him, because
his hour had not yet come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Again therefore he said to them: I go
away, and ye will seek me, and shall die in your sin. Whither I go,
ye can not come. <sup>22</sup>The Jews therefore said: Will he kill
himself? because he says: Whither I go, ye can not come.
<sup>23</sup>And he said to them: Ye are from beneath; I am from
above. Ye are of this world; I am not of this world. <sup>24</sup>I
said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins; for if ye
believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.
<sup>25</sup>Therefore they said to him: Who art thou? And Jesus
said to them: That which I also say to you from the beginning.
<sup>26</sup>I have many things to say and to judge concerning you.
But he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him,
these I speak to the world. <sup>27</sup>They understood not that
he spoke to them of the Father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Therefore Jesus said to them: When ye
shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am
he; and of myself I do nothing, but as the Father taught me, those
things I speak. <sup>29</sup>And he who sent me is with me. He has
not left me alone; because I do always the things that please him.
<sup>30</sup>As he spoke these words many believed on him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>Jesus therefore said to those Jews who
have believed him: If ye continue in my word, ye are truly my
disciples; <sup>32</sup>and ye shall know the truth, and the truth
will make you free. <sup>33</sup>They answered him: We are
Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to any one. How
sayest thou: Ye shall be made free? <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered
them: Verily, verily, I say to you, every one who commits sin is a
servant of sin. <sup>35</sup>And the servant abides not in the
house forever. <sup>36</sup>The Son abides forever; if therefore
the Son shall make you free, ye will be free indeed. <sup>37</sup>I
know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my
word has no place in you. <sup>38</sup>I speak what I have seen
with my Father; and ye therefore do what ye have heard from your
father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>They answered and said to him: Our
father is Abraham. Jesus says to them: If ye were children of
Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham. <sup>40</sup>But now ye
seek to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth, which I
heard from God. This Abraham did not. <sup>41</sup>Ye do the works
of your father. They said to him: We were not born of fornication;
we have one father, God. <sup>42</sup>Jesus said to them: If God
were your father, ye would love me; for from God I came forth, and
am come; neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.
<sup>43</sup>Why do ye not understand my speech? Because ye can not
hear my word. <sup>44</sup>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the
lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the
beginning, and abides not in the truth, because truth is not in
him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own; because he is a
liar, and the father of it. <sup>45</sup>And because I speak the
truth, ye believe me not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>Which of you convicts me of sin? If I
speak truth, why do ye not believe me? <sup>47</sup>He that is of
God hears God's words; ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>48</sup>The Jews answered and said to him: Say
we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
<sup>49</sup>Jesus answered: I have not a demon; but I honor my
Father, and ye dishonor me. <sup>50</sup>And I seek not my own
glory; there is one that seeks, and judges. <sup>51</sup>Verily,
verily, I say to you, if any one keep my saying, he shall not see
death, forever. <sup>52</sup>The Jews said to him: Now we know that
thou hast a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou
sayest: If a man keep my saying, he shall not taste of death,
forever. <sup>53</sup>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who
is dead? And the prophets are dead. Whom makest thou thyself?
<sup>54</sup>Jesus answered: If I honor myself, my honor is
nothing. It is my Father that honors me, of whom ye say, that he is
your God. <sup>55</sup>And ye know him not; but I know him. And if
I say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like to you. But I know
him, and I keep his word. <sup>56</sup>Abraham, your father,
rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
<sup>57</sup>The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty
years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? <sup>58</sup>Jesus said to
them: Verily, verily, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.
<sup>59</sup>They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But
Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> passing
along, he saw a man blind from his birth. <sup>2</sup>And his
disciples asked him, saying: Master, who sinned, this man or his
parents, that he should be born blind? <sup>3</sup>Jesus answered:
Neither this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God
should be made manifest in him. <sup>4</sup>I must work the works
of him who sent me, while it is day. Night is coming, when none can
work. <sup>5</sup>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of
the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Having thus spoken, he spit on the
ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the
blind man with the clay, <sup>7</sup>and said to him: Go, wash in
the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent). He went away
therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>The neighbors therefore, and they who
before had seen him that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that
sits and begs? <sup>9</sup>Some said: This is he; and others: He is
like him; he said: I am he. <sup>10</sup>Therefore they said to
him: How were thine eyes opened? <sup>11</sup>He answered: A man
called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me: Go
to the pool of Siloam, and wash. And I went away and washed, and
received sight. <sup>12</sup>They said to him: Where is he? He
said: I know not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>They bring to the Pharisees him who
before was blind. <sup>14</sup>And it was the sabbath when Jesus
made the clay, and opened his eyes. <sup>15</sup>Again therefore
the Pharisees also asked him, how he received sight. He said to
them: He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
<sup>16</sup>Therefore some of the Pharisees said: This man is not
from God, because he keeps not the sabbath. Others said: How can a
man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among
them. <sup>17</sup>They say to the blind man again: What sayest
thou of him, seeing that he opened thine eyes? He said: He is a
Prophet.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>The Jews therefore did not believe
concerning him, that he was blind and received sight, until they
called the parents of him that received sight. <sup>19</sup>And
they asked them, saying: Is this your son, who ye say was born
blind? How then does he now see? <sup>20</sup>His parents answered
them and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born
blind. <sup>21</sup>But by what means he now sees, we know not; or
who opened his eyes, we know not. He is of age; ask him. He shall
speak for himself. <sup>22</sup>These words spoke his parents,
because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had agreed already, that
if any one acknowledged him as Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogue. <sup>23</sup>Therefore his parents said: He is of age;
ask him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>They therefore called a second time the
man that was blind, and said to him: Give glory to God; we know
that this man is a sinner. <sup>25</sup>He answered therefore:
Whether he is a sinner, I know not; one thing I know, that, whereas
I was blind, now I see. <sup>26</sup>They therefore said to him:
What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes? <sup>27</sup>He
answered them: I told you already, and ye did not hear. Wherefore
would ye hear again? Will ye also become his disciples?
<sup>28</sup>They reviled him, and said: Thou art his disciple; but
we are Moses' disciples. <sup>29</sup>We know that God has spoken
to Moses; but this man we know not, whence he is. <sup>30</sup>The
man answered and said to them: Why herein is a marvelous thing,
that ye know not whence he is, and he opened mine eyes.
<sup>31</sup>Now we know that God hears not sinners. But if any one
is a worshiper of God, and does his will, him he hears.
<sup>32</sup>Since the world began, it was not heard that any one
opened the eyes of one born blind. <sup>33</sup>If this man were
not from God, he could do nothing. <sup>34</sup>They answered and
said to him: Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach
us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>Jesus heard that they cast him out; and
finding him, he said to him: Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
<sup>36</sup>He answered and said: Who then is he, Lord, that I may
believe on him? <sup>37</sup>And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both
seen him, and he it is that talks with thee. <sup>38</sup>And he
said: Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And Jesus said: For judgment came I
into this world; that they who see not may see, and that they who
see may become blind. <sup>40</sup>And some of the Pharisees who
were with him heard these words, and said to him: Are we also
blind? <sup>41</sup>Jesus said to them: If ye were blind, ye would
not have sin. But now ye say: We see. Your sin remains!</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;V<span class=
"sc">erily</span>, verily, I say to you: He that enters not through
the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same
is a thief and a robber. <sup>2</sup>But he that enters in through
the door is a shepherd of the sheep. <sup>3</sup>To him the porter
opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by
name, and leads them out. <sup>4</sup>And when he has put forth all
his own, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they
know his voice. <sup>5</sup>And a stranger they will not follow,
but will flee from him; because they know not the voice of
strangers.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>This parable spoke Jesus to them; but
they understood not what things they were which he spoke to
them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Therefore said Jesus to them again:
Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
<sup>8</sup>All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the
sheep did not hear them. <sup>9</sup>I am the door. If any one
enter in through me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and
find pasture. <sup>10</sup>The thief comes not but to steal, and to
kill, and to destroy. I came that they may have life, and that they
may have it abundantly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. <sup>12</sup>But he that
is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not,
sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees; and the wolf
catches them, and scatters the sheep. <sup>13</sup>The hireling
flees, because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.
<sup>14</sup>I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and am known
by mine, <sup>15</sup>as the Father knows me, and I know the
Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. <sup>16</sup>And
other sheep I have, which are not of this fold. Them also I must
bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock,
one shepherd. <sup>17</sup>For this the Father loves me, because I
lay down my life, that I may take it again. <sup>18</sup>No one
takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to
lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This
commandment I received from my Father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Again there arose a division among the
Jews because of these words. <sup>20</sup>And many of them said: He
has a demon, and is mad, why do ye hear him? <sup>21</sup>Others
said: These are not the words of one that has a demon. Can a demon
open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And there came the feast of the
dedication, in Jerusalem; and it was winter. <sup>23</sup>And Jesus
was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon.
<sup>24</sup>The Jews therefore came around him, and said to him:
How long dost thou hold us in doubt<sup><a href="#r431024" id=
"f431024" title="see footnote" name="f431024">24</a></sup>? If thou
art the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Jesus answered them: I told you, and ye
do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these bear
witness of me. <sup>26</sup>But ye do not believe; for ye are not
of my sheep, as I said to you. <sup>27</sup>My sheep hear my voice,
and I know them, and they follow me; <sup>28</sup>and I give to
them eternal life; and they shall never perish, nor shall any one
pluck them out of my hand. <sup>29</sup>My Father, who has given
them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to pluck them
out of my Father's hand. <sup>30</sup>I and the Father are one.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>The Jews therefore took up stones again
to stone him. <sup>32</sup>Jesus answered them: Many good works
have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye
stone me? <sup>33</sup>The Jews answered him: For a good work we
stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being man,
makest thyself God. <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered them: Is it not
written in your law, I said, <span class="ot">Ye are gods</span>?
<sup>35</sup>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came,
and the Scripture can not be broken, <sup>36</sup>say ye of him,
whom the Father sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou
blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? <sup>37</sup>If I
do not the works of my Father, believe me not. <sup>38</sup>But if
I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may
learn and know, that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
<sup>39</sup>Therefore they sought again to seize him; and he went
forth, out of their hand.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>And he went away again beyond the
Jordan, to the place where John was at first immersing; and there
he abode. <sup>41</sup>And many came to him, and said: John indeed
wrought no sign; but all things that John spoke of this man were
true. <sup>42</sup>And many believed on him there.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> a certain
one was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, from the village of Mary and
Martha her sister. <sup>2</sup>It was the Mary who anointed the
Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother
Lazarus was sick. <sup>3</sup>The sisters therefore sent to him,
saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. <sup>4</sup>And
Jesus hearing it, said: This sickness is not for death, but for the
sake of the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified
thereby.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister,
and Lazarus. <sup>6</sup>When therefore he heard that he was sick,
he then abode two days in the place where he was. <sup>7</sup>Then
after this he says to the disciples: Let us go into Jud&aelig;a
again. <sup>8</sup>The disciples say to him: Master, the Jews of
late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
<sup>9</sup>Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours in the day?
If any one walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the
light of this world. <sup>10</sup>But if any one walk in the night,
he stumbles, because the light is not in him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>These things said he; and after this he
says to them: Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep; but I go, that
I may awake him out of sleep. <sup>12</sup>Therefore his disciples
said: Lord if he has fallen asleep, he will be restored.
<sup>13</sup>But Jesus had spoken of his death; but they thought
that he said it of taking rest in sleep. <sup>14</sup>Then
therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.
<sup>15</sup>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there,
that ye may believe. But let us go to him. <sup>16</sup>Therefore
said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to his fellow disciples: Let us
also go, that we may die with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Having come therefore, Jesus found that
he had already been four days in the tomb.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem,
about fifteen furlongs off. <sup>19</sup>And many of the Jews had
come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their
brother.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Therefore Martha, when she heard that
Jesus is coming, went and met him; but Mary sat in the house.
<sup>21</sup>Then said Martha to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been
here, my brother had not died. <sup>22</sup>But even now, I know
that whatever thou shalt ask of God, God will give it thee.
<sup>23</sup>Jesus says to her: Thy brother will rise again.
<sup>24</sup>Martha says to him: I know that he will rise again, in
the resurrection at the last day. <sup>25</sup>Jesus said to her: I
am the resurrection, and the life; he that believes on me, though
he be dead, yet shall he live; <sup>26</sup>and whoever lives and
believes on me, shall never die. Believest thou this?
<sup>27</sup>She says to him: Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art
the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And having said this, she went away,
and called Mary her sister secretly, saying: The Teacher is come,
and calls for thee. <sup>29</sup>And she, when she heard it, rises
quickly and comes to him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>Now Jesus had not yet come into the
village, but was in the place where Martha met him.
<sup>31</sup>The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and
comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went
out, followed her, saying: She goes to the tomb to weep there.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>Mary therefore, when she came where
Jesus was, seeing him, fell down at his feet, saying to him: Lord,
if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Jesus therefore, when he saw her
weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, groaned in spirit,
and was troubled. <sup>34</sup>And he said: Where have ye laid him?
They say to him: Lord, come and see. <sup>35</sup>Jesus wept.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>The Jews therefore said: Behold how he
loved him! <sup>37</sup>And some of them said: Could not this man,
who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused even that this man
should not have died? <sup>38</sup>Jesus therefore, again groaning
in himself, comes to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon
it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>Jesus says: Take away the stone. The
sister of him that was dead, Martha, says to him: Lord, by this
time he is offensive; for he has been dead four days.
<sup>40</sup>Jesus says to her: Said I not to thee, that, if thou
believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>So they took away the stone. And Jesus
raised his eyes upward, and said: Father, I thank thee that thou
didst hear me. <sup>42</sup>And I knew that thou always hearest me;
but for the sake of the multitude standing around I said it, that
they might believe that thou didst send me. <sup>43</sup>And having
thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.
<sup>44</sup>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot
with grave clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin.
Jesus says to them: Loose him, and let him go.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>45</sup>Many therefore of the Jews who came to
Mary, and saw what he did, believed on him. <sup>46</sup>But some
of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus
did.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>47</sup>Therefore the chief priests and the
Pharisees gathered a council, and said: What do we, seeing that
this man works many signs? <sup>48</sup>If we let him thus alone,
all will believe on him; and the Romans will come and take away
both our place and nation. <sup>49</sup>And a certain one of them,
Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them: Ye know
nothing; <sup>50</sup>nor do ye consider that it is expedient for
us, that one man die for the people, and not the whole nation
perish. <sup>51</sup>And this he spoke not of himself; but being
high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the
nation; <sup>52</sup>and not for the nation only, but that also he
should gather together into one the children of God that were
scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>53</sup>Therefore from that day forth they took
counsel together to put him to death. <sup>54</sup>Jesus therefore
no longer walked openly among the Jews; but departed thence to the
country near to the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there
continued with his disciples.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>55</sup>And the passover of the Jews was at
hand; and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country, before the
passover, that they might purify themselves. <sup>56</sup>They
sought therefore for Jesus, and said among themselves, as they
stood in the temple: What think ye, that he will not come to the
feast? <sup>57</sup>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had
given a commandment, that, if any one knew where he was, he should
make it known, that they might seize him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">herefore</span>
Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus
was who had been dead, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
<sup>2</sup>They therefore made him a supper there, and Martha
served; and Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Then Mary took a pound of ointment of
pure spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and
wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the
odor of the ointment. <sup>4</sup>Then says one of his disciples,
Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was about to betray him:
<sup>5</sup>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred
den&aacute;ries<sup><a href="#r431205" id="f431205" title=
"see footnote" name="f431205">5</a></sup>, and given to the poor?
<sup>6</sup>This he said, not because he cared for the poor; but
because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore<sup><a href=
"#r431206" id="f431206" title="see footnote" name=
"f431206">6</a></sup> what was put therein. <sup>7</sup>Then said
Jesus: Let her alone; she has kept it<sup><a href="#r431207" id=
"f431207" title="see footnote" name="f431207">7</a></sup> to the
day of my preparation for burial. <sup>8</sup>For the poor ye have
always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>A great multitude of the Jews therefore
knew that he was there. And they came, not because of Jesus only,
but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the
dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>But the chief priests consulted that
they might put Lazarus also to death; <sup>11</sup>because by
reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on
Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>On the morrow a great multitude that
had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus is coming to Jerusalem,
<sup>13</sup>took branches of the palm-trees and went forth to meet
him, and cried: Hosanna; blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord, the King of Israel. <sup>14</sup>And Jesus, having found a
young ass, sat thereon; as it is written:</p>
<p class="pp4"><sup>15</sup>Fear not, daughter of Zion;</p>
<p class="pp4">Behold, thy King comes,</p>
<p class="pp4">Sitting on an ass's colt.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>16</sup>These things his disciples understood
not at the first. But when Jesus was glorified, then they
remembered that these things were written of him, and that they did
these things to him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>The multitude therefore that was with
him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the
dead, bore witness. <sup>18</sup>For this the multitude also met
him, because they heard that he had wrought this sign.
<sup>19</sup>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves:
Perceive ye that ye avail nothing? Behold, the world is gone after
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And there were certain Greeks, of those
who come up to worship at the feast. <sup>21</sup>These came
therefore to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired
him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus. <sup>22</sup>Philip comes and
tells Andrew; Andrew and Philip come and tell Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And Jesus answered them, saying: The
hour has come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
<sup>24</sup>Verily, verily, I say to you, except the grain of
wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone; but if it die,
it brings forth much fruit. <sup>25</sup>He that loves his life
shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep
it unto life eternal. <sup>26</sup>If any one serve me, let him
follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be. If any
one serve me, him will the Father honor.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall
I say? Father, save me from this hour<sup><a href="#r431227" id=
"f431227" title="see footnote" name="f431227">27</a></sup>! But for
this cause came I unto this hour. <sup>28</sup>Father, glorify thy
name. Then there came a voice out of heaven: I both have glorified
it, and will glorify it again.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>The multitude therefore that stood by
and heard, said that it thundered; others said: An angel has spoken
to him. <sup>30</sup>Jesus answered and said: This voice came not
for my sake, but for your sakes. <sup>31</sup>Now is the judgment
of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
<sup>32</sup>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
men to me. <sup>33</sup>This he said, signifying by what manner of
death he should die.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>The multitude answered him: We heard
out of the law that the Christ abides forever; and how sayest thou:
The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
<sup>35</sup>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while is
the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness
may not overtake you; and he that walks in the darkness knows not
whither he goes. <sup>36</sup>While ye have the light, believe on
the light, that ye may become sons of light.</p>
<p class="pin">These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and hid
himself from them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>But though he had wrought so many signs
before them, they did not believe on him; <sup>38</sup>that the
saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he
spoke:</p>
<p class="pp2">Lord, who believed our report,</p>
<p class="pp2">And to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>Therefore they could not believe,
because Isaiah said again:</p>
<p class="pp3"><sup>40</sup>He has blinded their eyes,</p>
<p class="pp3">And has hardened their heart;</p>
<p class="pp3">That they should not see with their eyes,</p>
<p class="pp3">And understand with their heart,</p>
<p class="pp3">And turn, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>These things said Isaiah, because he
saw his glory, and spoke of him. <sup>42</sup>Yet, even of the
rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did
not acknowledge him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
<sup>43</sup>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>And Jesus cried and said: He that
believes on me, believes not on me but on him who sent me.
<sup>45</sup>And he that beholds me beholds him who sent me.
<sup>46</sup>I have come a light into the world, that whoever
believes on me may not abide in the darkness. <sup>47</sup>And if
any one hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him; for I
came not to judge the world, but to save the world. <sup>48</sup>He
that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges
him. The word that I spokes that shall judge him in the last day.
<sup>49</sup>Because I spoke not from myself; but the Father who
sent me, he has given me a commandment, what I should say, and what
I should speak. <sup>50</sup>And I know that his commandment is
everlasting life. What things I speak therefore, as the Father has
said to me, so I speak.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> before
the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour has come
that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved
his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.
<sup>2</sup>And supper being served, the Devil having already put
into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
<sup>3</sup>knowing that the Father has given all things into his
hands, and that he came out from God, and is going to God,
<sup>4</sup>he rises from the supper, and lays aside his garments,
and taking a towel he girded himself. <sup>5</sup>After that he
pours water into the basin, and began to wash the feet of his
disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was
girded.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>He comes therefore to Simon Peter; and
Peter says to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet? <sup>7</sup>Jesus
answered and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou
shalt know hereafter. <sup>8</sup>Peter says to him: Never shalt
thou wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou
hast no part with me. <sup>9</sup>Simon Peter says to him: Lord,
not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. <sup>10</sup>Jesus
says to him: He that has bathed has no need save to wash the feet,
but is wholly clean. And ye are clean; but not all.
<sup>11</sup>For he knew his betrayer; therefore he said: Ye are
not all clean.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>When therefore he had washed their
feet, he took his garments, and reclining again at table, said to
them: Know ye what I have done to you? <sup>13</sup>Ye call me the
Teacher, and the Master; and ye say well, for so I am.
<sup>14</sup>If I then, the Master and the Teacher, washed your
feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. <sup>15</sup>For I
gave you an example, that as I did to you, ye also should do.
<sup>16</sup>Verily, verily, I say to you, a servant is not greater
than his lord, nor one that is sent<sup><a href="#r431316" id=
"f431316" title="see footnote" name="f431316">16</a></sup> greater
than he who sent him. <sup>17</sup>If ye know these things, happy
are ye if ye do them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>I speak not of you all; I know whom I
chose; but that the scripture might be fulfilled, <span class=
"ot">He that eats the loaf with me lifted up his heel against
me.</span> <sup>19</sup>Even now I tell you, before it comes to
pass, that when it comes to pass, ye may believe that I am he.
<sup>20</sup>Verily, verily, I say to you, he that receives
whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him
who sent me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Having said this, Jesus was troubled in
spirit, and testified and said: Verily, verily, I say to you, that
one of you will betray me. <sup>22</sup>The disciples therefore
looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke. <sup>23</sup>And
there was reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom
Jesus loved. <sup>24</sup>To him therefore Simon Peter beckons, and
says to him: Say who it is of whom he speaks. <sup>25</sup>And he,
leaning back on Jesus' breast, says to him: Lord, who is it?
<sup>26</sup>Jesus answers: He it is, to whom I shall give the
morsel, when I have dipped it. And having dipped the morsel, he
gives it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. <sup>27</sup>And after
the morsel, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore says to
him: What thou doest, do quickly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And no one at the table knew for what
intent he spoke this to him. <sup>29</sup>For some thought, because
Judas had the bag, that Jesus said to him: Buy what we need for the
feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>He then, having received the morsel,
went immediately out; and it was night.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>When therefore he was gone out, Jesus
says: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
<sup>32</sup>If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him
in himself, and will straightway glorify him.
<sup>33</sup>Children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye will
seek me; and as I said to the Jews, whither I go ye can not come,
so now I say to you. <sup>34</sup>A new commandment I give to you,
that ye love one another; as I loved you, that ye also love one
another. <sup>35</sup>By this shall all know that ye are my
disciples, if ye have love one toward another.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>Simon Peter says to him: Lord, whither
goest thou? Jesus answered him: Whither I go, thou canst not follow
me now; but thou shalt follow me afterward. <sup>37</sup>Peter says
to him: Lord, why can not I follow thee now? I will lay down my
life for thee. <sup>38</sup>Jesus answers: Wilt thou lay down thy
life for me? Verily, verily, I say to thee, a cock will not crow,
till thou hast denied me thrice.</p>

says to him: I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to
the Father, but by me. <sup>7</sup>If ye knew me, ye would know my
Father also; and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Philip says to him: Lord, show us the

than these shall he do, because I go to the Father.

loves me, he will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we
will come to him, and make our abode with him. <sup>24</sup>He that

and as the Father gave me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go
hence.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">XV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I
<span class="sc">am</span> the true vine, and my Father is the
husbandman. <sup>2</sup>Every branch in me that bears not fruit, he
takes it away; and every one that bears fruit, he cleanses it, that
it may bear more fruit. <sup>3</sup>Ye are already clean, through
the word which I have spoken to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch
can not bear fruit of itself, if it abide not in the vine, so
neither can ye, if ye abide not in me. <sup>5</sup>I am the vine,
ye are the branches. He that abides in me and I in him, the same
bears much fruit; because without me ye can do nothing.
<sup>6</sup>If any one abide not in me, he is cast forth as the
branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into
the fire, and they are burned. <sup>7</sup>If ye abide in me, and
my words abide in you, ask whatever ye will, and it shall be done
to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye
bear much fruit; and ye shall become my disciples. <sup>9</sup>As
the Father loved me, I also loved you; abide in my love.
<sup>10</sup>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love;
as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>These things I have spoken to you, that
my joy may be in you, and your joy be made full. <sup>12</sup>This
is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I loved you.
<sup>13</sup>Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down
his life for his friends. <sup>14</sup>Ye are my friends, if ye do
whatever I command you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>No longer do I call you servants;
because the servant knows not what his lord does. But I have called
you friends because all things that I heard from my Father I made
known to you. <sup>16</sup>Ye did not choose me, but I chose you,
and appointed you that ye may go and bear fruit, and that your
fruit may remain; that whatever ye shall ask of the Father in my
name, he may give it you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>These things I command you, that ye
love one another. <sup>18</sup>If the world hates you, ye know that
it has hated me before it hated you. <sup>19</sup>If ye were of the
world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the
world, but I chose you out of the world, for this the world hates
you. <sup>20</sup>Remember the word that I said to you: A servant
is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also
persecute you; if they kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
<sup>21</sup>But all these things they will do to you for my name's
sake, because they know not him who sent me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>If I had not come and spoken to them,
they would not have sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin.
<sup>23</sup>He that hates me hates my Father also. <sup>24</sup>If
I had not done among them the works which no other one has done,
they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both
me and my Father. <sup>25</sup>But this comes to pass, that the
word might be fulfilled that is written in their law: <span class=
"ot">They hated me without a cause.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>But when the Comforter is come, whom I
will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which
proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness of me.
<sup>27</sup>And ye also shall bear witness, because ye are with me
from the beginning.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">hese</span> things I
have spoken to you, that ye should not be offended.
<sup>2</sup>They will put you out of the synagogues; yea, a time is
coming, that every one who kills you will think he makes an
offering to God. <sup>3</sup>And these things they will do to you,
because they have not known the Father, nor me. <sup>4</sup>But
these things I have spoken to you, that when the time shall come,
ye may remember that I told you. And these things I told you not
from the beginning, because I was with you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And now I go to him who sent me; and
none of you asks me: Whither goest thou? <sup>6</sup>But because I
have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
<sup>7</sup>But I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that
I depart; for if I depart not, the Comforter will not come to you;
but if I go, I will send him to you. <sup>8</sup>And when he is
come, he will convict the world, in respect of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment; <sup>9</sup>of sin, in that they
believe not on me; <sup>10</sup>of righteousness, in that I go to
my Father, and ye behold me no more; <sup>11</sup>of judgment, in
that the prince of this world has been judged.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>I have yet many things to say to you,
but ye can not bear them now. <sup>13</sup>But when he, the Spirit
of truth is come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will
not speak from himself, but whatever he shall hear, that will he
speak, and he will tell you the things to come. <sup>14</sup>He
will glorify me; because he will receive of mine, and will tell it
to you. <sup>15</sup>All things that the Father has are mine.
Therefore, I said, that he will receive of mine, and will tell it
to you. <sup>16</sup>A little while, and ye behold me not; and
again a little while, and ye shall see me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Therefore some of his disciples said to
one another: What is this that he says to us, A little while, and
ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me;
and, I go to the Father? <sup>18</sup>They said therefore: What is
this that he says, A little while? We know not what he says.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Jesus knew that they were desirous to
ask him, and said to them: Do ye inquire of this with one another,
that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a
little while, and ye shall see me? <sup>20</sup>Verily, verily, I
say to you, that ye will weep and lament, but the world will
rejoice; and ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned
into joy. <sup>21</sup>A woman when she is in travail has sorrow,
because her hour is come; but when she has borne the child, she
remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the
world. <sup>22</sup>And so ye now have sorrow; but I will see you
again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from
you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And in that day ye shall ask nothing of
me. Verily, verily, I say to you: Whatever ye shall ask of the
Father, he will give it you in my name. <sup>24</sup>Hitherto ye
asked nothing in my name. Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy
may be made full.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>These things I have spoken to you in
parables. A time is coming, when I will no more speak to you in
parables, but I will tell you plainly of the Father.
<sup>26</sup>In that day ye shall ask in my name. And I say not to
you, that I will pray the Father for you; <sup>27</sup>for the
Father himself loves you, because ye have loved me, and have
believed that I came forth from God. <sup>28</sup>I came forth from
the Father, and have come into the world; again, I leave the world,
and go to the Father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>His disciples say to him: Lo, now thou
speakest plainly, and speakest no parable. <sup>30</sup>Now we know
that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any one should
ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>Jesus answered them: Do ye now believe?
<sup>32</sup>Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that ye will
be scattered, each one to his own, and will leave me alone; and I
am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>These things I have spoken to you, that
in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation; but be
of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">hese</span> words
spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said: Father,
the hour has come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee;
<sup>2</sup>as thou gayest him authority over all flesh, that as
many as thou hast given to him, to them he should give eternal
life. <sup>3</sup>And this is the eternal life, that they know thee
the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou didst send.
<sup>4</sup>I glorified thee on the earth; I finished the work
which thou hast given me to do. <sup>5</sup>And now, O Father,
glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had
with thee before the world was. <sup>6</sup>I manifested thy name
to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they
were, and thou hast given them to me; and they have kept thy word.
<sup>7</sup>Now they know that all things whatever thou hast given
me are from thee; <sup>8</sup>because the words which thou gayest
me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew in truth
that I came forth from thee, and believed that thou didst send me.
<sup>9</sup>I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for
those whom thou hast given me; because they are thine.
<sup>10</sup>And all things that are mine are thine, and thine are
mine; and I am glorified in them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And I am no longer in the world; and
these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep those
in thy name whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we
are, <sup>12</sup>While I was with them, I kept them in thy name.
Those whom thou hast given me I watched over and none of them
perished, except the son of perdition, that the scripture might be
fulfilled. <sup>13</sup>And now I come to thee; and these things I
speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in them.
<sup>14</sup>I have given them thy word; and the world hated them,
because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
<sup>15</sup>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the
world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
<sup>16</sup>They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
<sup>17</sup>Sanctify them in the truth; thy word is truth.
<sup>18</sup>As thou didst send me into the world, I also sent them
into the world. <sup>19</sup>And for their sakes I sanctify myself,
that they also may be sanctified in the truth. <sup>20</sup>And I
pray not for these only, but also for those who believe on me
through their word; <sup>21</sup>that all may be one; as thou,
Father, in me and I in thee, that they also may be in us; that the
world may believe that thou didst send me. <sup>22</sup>And the
glory which thou hast given to me I have given to them, that they
may be one, as we are one; <sup>23</sup>I in them, and thou in me,
that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that
thou didst send me, and lovedst them as thou lovedst me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Father, those whom thou hast given me,
I will that where I am they also be with me; that they may behold
my glory, which thou hast given me; because thou lovedst me before
the foundation of the world. <sup>25</sup>Righteous Father! And the
world knew thee not! But I knew thee, and these knew that thou
didst send me; <sup>26</sup>and I made known to them thy name, and
will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be
in them, and I in them.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

spoken these words, Jesus went out with his disciples beyond the
brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered and his
disciples. <sup>2</sup>And Judas also, his betrayer knew the place;
because Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Judas therefore, having received the
band and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes
thither with torches and lamps and weapons. <sup>4</sup>Jesus
therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went
forth and said to them: Whom do ye seek? <sup>5</sup>They answered
him: Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus says to them: I am he. And Judas
also, his betrayer, was standing with them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>When therefore he said to them, I am he,
they went backward, and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Again therefore he asked them: Whom do
ye seek? And they said: Jesus the Nazarene. <sup>8</sup>Jesus
answered: I told you that I am he; if therefore ye seek me, let
these go their way; <sup>9</sup>that the saying might be fulfilled,
which he spoke: Of those whom thou hast given me, I lost none.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew
it and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right
ear. The servant's name was Malchus. <sup>11</sup>Jesus therefore
said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the sheath. The cup which my
Father has given me, shall I not drink it?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>So the band, and the captain, and the
officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him, <sup>13</sup>and
led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas,
who was high priest that year. <sup>14</sup>And it was Caiaphas who
counseled the Jews, that it is expedient that one man should die
for the people.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And Simon Peter and the other disciple
followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and
went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.
<sup>16</sup>But Peter was standing at the door without. Therefore
the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and
spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
<sup>17</sup>Then the damsel that kept the door says to Peter: Art
not thou also one of this man's disciples? He says: I am not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And the servants and the officers were
standing there, having made a fire of coals, because it was cold,
and were warming themselves; and Peter was standing with them, and
warming himself.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>The high priest therefore asked Jesus
concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching.
<sup>20</sup>Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world;
I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where all the
Jews assemble; and I spoke nothing in secret. <sup>21</sup>Why
askest thou me? Ask those who have heard, what I spoke to them.
Behold, these know what things I said.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And when he had said this, one of the
officers who was standing by gave Jesus a blow on the face, saying:
Answerest thou the high priest so? <sup>23</sup>Jesus answered him:
If I spoke evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why dost
thou smite me?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the
high priest. <sup>25</sup>And Simon Peter was standing and warming
himself. They said therefore to him: Art thou also one of his
disciples? He denied, and said: I am not. <sup>26</sup>One of the
servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter
cut off, says: Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
<sup>27</sup>Again therefore Peter denied; and immediately a cock
crowed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas into
the Governor's palace; and it was early; and they themselves went
not into the palace, that they might not be defiled, but might eat
the passover. <sup>29</sup>Pilate therefore went out to them, and
said: What accusation do ye bring against this man?
<sup>30</sup>They answered and said to him: If this man were not a
malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.
<sup>31</sup>Pilate therefore said to them: Do ye take him, and
judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It
is not lawful for us to put any one to death; <sup>32</sup>that the
saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by
what manner of death he should die.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Pilate therefore entered into the
palace again, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the King
of the Jews? <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered: Dost thou say this of
thyself, or did others tell thee concerning me? <sup>35</sup>Pilate
answered: Am I a Jew? Thine own nation, and the chief priests,
delivered thee up to me. What didst thou? <sup>36</sup>Jesus
answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of
this world, my servants would fight, that I might not be delivered
up to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence.
<sup>37</sup>Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then?
Jesus answered: Thou sayest it; because I am a king. To this end
have I been born, and to this end have I come into the world, that
I may bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth
hears my voice.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>Pilate says to him: What is truth? And
having said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them:
I find no fault in him. <sup>39</sup>But ye have a custom, that I
should release to you one at the passover. Do ye desire therefore
that I release to you the King of the Jews? <sup>40</sup>They all
therefore cried out again, saying: Not this one, but Barabbas. Now
Barabbas was a robber.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">hen</span> therefore
Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him. <sup>2</sup>And the soldiers
platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and put on him a
purple robe; and they came to him, <sup>3</sup>and said: Hail, King
of the Jews! And they gave him blows on the face.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Pilate went forth again, and says to
them: Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I
find no fault in him. <sup>5</sup>Jesus therefore came forth,
wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And he says to
them: Behold the man!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>When therefore the chief priests and the
officers saw him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.
Pilate says to them: Do ye take him, and crucify him; for I find no
fault in him. <sup>7</sup>The Jews answered him: We have a law, and
by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>When therefore Pilate heard this saying,
he was the more afraid. <sup>9</sup>And he went again into the
palace, and says to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no
answer. <sup>10</sup>Then says Pilate to him: Dost thou not speak
to me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have
power to crucify thee? <sup>11</sup>Jesus answered: Thou wouldst
have no power against me, except it were given thee from above.
Therefore he that delivers me to thee has the greater sin.
<sup>12</sup>Thenceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews
cried out, saying: If thou let this man go, thou art not a friend
of C&aelig;sar. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against
C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>When therefore Pilate heard these
words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment-seat in
a place called the Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
<sup>14</sup>And it was the preparation of the passover, and about
the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews: Behold your king!
<sup>15</sup>But they cried out: Away with him, away with him,
crucify him. Pilate says to them: Shall I crucify your king? The
chief priests answered: We have no king but C&aelig;sar.
<sup>16</sup>Then therefore he delivered him to them to be
crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And bearing his cross he went forth
into the place called Place of a skull, which in Hebrew is called
Golgotha; <sup>18</sup>where they crucified him, and two others
with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
<sup>19</sup>And Pilate wrote also a title, and put it on the
cross. And the writing was: JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE
JEWS.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>This title therefore many of the Jews
read; because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the
city, and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
<sup>21</sup>Therefore said the chief priests of the Jews to
Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am
King of the Jews. <sup>22</sup>Pilate answered: What I have
written, I have written.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>Then the soldiers, when they crucified
Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a
part, and also his coat. And the coat was without a seam, woven
from the top throughout. <sup>24</sup>They said therefore to one
another: Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall
be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says:</p>
<p class="pp1">They parted my garments among them.</p>
<p class="pp1">And for my vesture they cast lots.</p>
<p class="pin">These things the soldiers did. <sup>25</sup>And
there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene.
<sup>26</sup>Jesus therefore seeing his mother, and the disciple
whom he loved standing by, says to his mother: Woman, behold thy
son! <sup>27</sup>Then he says to the disciple: Behold thy mother!
And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>After this, Jesus knowing that all
things were now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished,
says: I thirst. <sup>29</sup>Now there was set a vessel full of
vinegar; and they, having filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it
on a hyssop-stalk, bore it to his mouth. <sup>30</sup>When Jesus
therefore received the vinegar, he said: It is finished; and he
bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>The Jews therefore, since it was the
preparation, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the
sabbath (for that sabbath day was a great day), besought Pilate
that their legs might be broken, and they be taken away.
<sup>32</sup>The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of
the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.
<sup>33</sup>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was
already dead, they broke not his legs. <sup>34</sup>But one of the
soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith there came
out blood and water.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And he that has seen has borne witness,
and his witness is true, and he knows that he says what is true,
that ye also might believe. <sup>36</sup>For these things came to
pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled: <span class="ot">A
bone of him shall not be broken.</span> <sup>37</sup>And again
another scripture says: <span class="ot">They shall look on him
whom they pierced.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And after this, Joseph from
Arimath&aelig;a, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear
of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of
Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took away
the body of Jesus. <sup>39</sup>And there came also Nicodemus, who
at the first came to Jesus by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh
and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight. <sup>40</sup>They took
therefore the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths with the
spices, as is the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And in the place where he was crucified
there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no
one was yet laid. <sup>42</sup>There they laid Jesus therefore, on
account of the preparation of the Jews, because the sepulchre was
nigh at hand.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> on the
first day of the week Mary the Magdalene comes early, while it is
yet dark, to the sepulchre, and sees the stone taken away out of
the sepulchre. <sup>2</sup>She runs therefore and comes to Simon
Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and says to
them: They took away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not
where they laid him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Peter therefore went forth, and the
other disciple, and they went to the sepulchre. <sup>4</sup>And the
two ran together; and the other disciple outran Peter, and came
first to the sepulchre. <sup>5</sup>And stooping down he sees the
linen cloths lying; yet he went not in. <sup>6</sup>Then comes
Simon Peter following him; and he went into the sepulchre, and sees
the linen cloths lying, <sup>7</sup>and the napkin that was about
his head not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a
place by itself. <sup>8</sup>Then therefore the other disciple, who
came first to the sepulchre, went in also; and he saw, and
believed. <sup>9</sup>For not even yet did they know the scripture,
that he must rise from the dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>The disciples therefore went away again
to their own home. <sup>11</sup>And Mary was standing by the
sepulchre without, weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped clown into
the sepulchre, <sup>12</sup>and beholds two angels in white,
sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the
body of Jesus lay. <sup>13</sup>And they say to her: Woman, why
weepest thou? She says to them: Because they took away my Lord, and
I know not where they laid him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Having said this, she turned back and
beholds Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
<sup>15</sup>Jesus says to her: Woman, why weepest thou? Whom dost
thou seek? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him:
Sir, if thou didst bear him hence, tell me where thou laidest him,
and I will take him away. <sup>16</sup>Jesus says to her: Mary!
Turning, she says to him in Hebrew: Rabboni! (which is to say,
Teacher!) <sup>17</sup>Jesus says to her: Touch me not; for I have
not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say to
them: I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Mary the Magdalene comes bringing word
to the disciples, that she has seen the Lord, and that he spoke
these things to her.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>When therefore it was evening on that
day, the first day of the week, the doors having been shut, where
the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and
stood in the midst; and he says to them: Peace be to you.
<sup>20</sup>And having said this, he showed them his hands and his
side. The disciples rejoiced therefore, when they saw the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Jesus therefore said to them again:
Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.
<sup>22</sup>And having said this, he breathed on them, and says to
them: Receive the Holy Spirit. <sup>23</sup>Whosesoever sins ye
remit, they are remitted to them; and whosesoever ye retain, they
are retained.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called
Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. <sup>25</sup>The other
disciples therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said
to them: Except I see in his hands the print of the nails, and
thrust my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand
into his side, I will not believe.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And after eight days, again his
disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors
being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.
<sup>27</sup>After that, he says to Thomas: Reach hither thy
finger, and see my hands; and reach thy hand, and thrust it into my
side; and be not faithless, but believing. <sup>28</sup>Thomas
answered and said to him: My Lord, and my God. <sup>29</sup>Jesus
says to him: Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed. Happy
they who saw not, and have believed!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>Many other signs also did Jesus in the
presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.
<sup>31</sup>But these are written, that ye might believe that
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have
life in his name.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">fter</span> these
things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea
of Tiberias; and he manifested himself in this manner.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>There were together Simon Peter, and
Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and the
sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. <sup>3</sup>Simon
Peter says to them: I go a fishing. They say to him: We also go
with thee. They went forth, and entered into the ship; and in that
night they caught nothing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>But when morning was now come, Jesus
stood on the beach; yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
<sup>5</sup>Jesus therefore says to them: Children, have ye
anything to eat? They answered him: No. <sup>6</sup>And he said to
them: Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall
find. They cast it therefore; and now they were not able to draw
it, for the multitude of the fishes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved
says to Peter: It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, hearing that
it is the Lord, girded on his outer garment (for he was naked), and
cast himself into the sea. <sup>8</sup>And the other disciples came
in the boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred
cubits off), dragging the net with the fishes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>When therefore they went out upon the
land, they see a fire of coals there, and a fish lying thereon, and
bread. <sup>10</sup>Jesus says to them: Bring of the fishes which
ye just now caught. <sup>11</sup>Simon Peter went on board, and
drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and
three; and though there were so many, the net was not broken.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Jesus says to them: Come hither, and
break your fast. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art
thou? knowing that it is the Lord. <sup>13</sup>Jesus comes, and
takes the bread and gives to them, and the fish likewise.
<sup>14</sup>This the third time already, Jesus manifested himself
to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>When therefore they had broken their
fast, Jesus says to Simon Peter: Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou
me more than these? He says to him: Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I
love thee. He says to him: Feed my lambs.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>He says to him again a second time:
Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me? He says to him: Yea, Lord;
thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him: Tend my sheep.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>He says to him the third time: Simon,
son of Jonah, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said to
him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou
knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus says to
him: Feed my sheep.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Verily, verily, I say to thee, when
thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself, and walk whither thou
wouldst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy
hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou
wouldst not. <sup>19</sup>And this he spoke, signifying by what
manner of death he should glorify God.</p>
<p class="pin">And having spoken this, he says to him: Follow me.
<sup>20</sup>Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus
loved following; who also at the supper leaned back on his breast,
and said: Lord, who is he that betrays thee? <sup>21</sup>Peter
seeing him says to Jesus: Lord, and what shall this man do?
<sup>22</sup>Jesus says to him: If I will that he remain till I
come, what is it to thee? Do thou follow me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>This saying therefore went abroad among
the brethren, that that disciple should not die. And Jesus said not
to him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I
come, what is it to thee?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>This is the disciple who testifies of
these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his
testimony is true. <sup>25</sup>And there are also many other
things which Jesus did; and if they should be written every one, I
suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that
should be written.</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class=
"sc">he</span> former narration I made, O Theophilus, concerning
all things that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
<sup>2</sup>until the day when he was taken up, after he had given
commandment, through the Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he
chose; <sup>3</sup>to whom also he showed himself living, after he
had suffered, by many infallible proofs, during forty days
appearing to them, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom
of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And, being assembled together with them,
he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the
promise of the Father, which ye heard from me; <sup>5</sup>for John
indeed immersed in water; but ye shall be immersed in the Holy
Spirit, not many days hence.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>They therefore, having come
together<sup><a href="#r440106" id="f440106" title="see footnote"
name="f440106">6</a></sup>, asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at
this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? <sup>7</sup>And he
said to them: It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the
Father appointed by his own authority<sup><a href="#r440107" id=
"f440107" title="see footnote" name="f440107">7</a></sup>.
<sup>8</sup>But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is
come upon you; and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and
in all Jud&aelig;a, and Samaria, and unto the utmost part of the
earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And having spoken these things, while
they beheld he was borne up, and a cloud received him out of their
sight. <sup>10</sup>And while they were looking intently into
heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
<sup>11</sup>who also said: Men of Galilee, why stand ye looking
into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye saw him going into heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Then they returned to Jerusalem from
the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's
journey. <sup>13</sup>And when they came in, they went up into the
upper room, where were abiding both Peter, and James, and John, and
Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son
of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.
<sup>14</sup>These all continued with one accord in prayer, with
women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And in those days Peter stood up in the
midst of the brethren, and said (the number of names together was
about a hundred and twenty): <sup>16</sup>Men, brethren, it was
necessary that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who
became guide to those who took Jesus. <sup>17</sup>Because he was
numbered with us, and obtained the office of this ministry.&mdash;
<sup>18</sup>Now this man purchased a field with the wages of
iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and
all his bowels gushed out. <sup>19</sup>And it became known to all
who dwell at Jerusalem; so that that field was called, in their own
tongue, Aceldama, that is, Field of blood.&mdash; <sup>20</sup>For
it is written in the book of Psalms:</p>
<p class="pp4">Let his habitation be made desolate,</p>
<p class="pp4">And let no one dwell therein.</p>
<p class="pnn">And:</p>
<p class="pp4">Let another take his office<sup><a href="#r440120"
id="f440120" title="see footnote" name="f440120">20</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Therefore, of these men, who
accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out
among us, <sup>22</sup>beginning from John's immersion, unto the
day when he was taken up from us, must one be made a witness with
us of his resurrection.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And they appointed two, Joseph called
Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. <sup>24</sup>And
they prayed, saying: Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all,
show which of these two thou didst choose, <sup>25</sup>that he may
take part in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by
transgression fell away, that he might go to his own place.
<sup>26</sup>And they gave their lots<sup><a href="#r440126" id=
"f440126" title="see footnote" name="f440126">26</a></sup>; and the
lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven
apostles.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> when the
day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in
one place. <sup>2</sup>And suddenly there came a sound out of
heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house
where they were sitting. <sup>3</sup>And there appeared to them
tongues as of fire, distributed among them; and it sat upon each of
them. <sup>4</sup>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit,
and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
utterance.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem,
Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. <sup>6</sup>And
this being noised abroad<sup><a href="#r440206" id="f440206" title=
"see footnote" name="f440206">6</a></sup>, the multitude came
together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak
in his own language. <sup>7</sup>And all were amazed, and wondered,
saying one to another Behold, are not all these who speak
Galil&aelig;ans? <sup>8</sup>And how do we hear, every man in our
own tongue, wherein we were born, <sup>9</sup>Parthians and Medes
and Elamites, and those who inhabit Mesopotamia, Jud&aelig;a and
Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup>10</sup>Phrygia and Pamphylia,
Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
both Jews and proselytes, <sup>11</sup>Cretes and Arabians, hear
them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God?
<sup>12</sup>And all were amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
another: What may this mean? <sup>13</sup>But others mocking said:
They are filled with sweet wine.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>But Peter, standing up with the eleven,
lifted up his voice, and said to them: Men of Jud&aelig;a, and all
that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and hearken to my
words. <sup>15</sup>For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, for
it is the third hour of the day. <sup>16</sup>But this is what was
spoken through the prophet Joel:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>17</sup>And it shall be in the last days, saith
God,</p>
<p class="pp1">That I will pour out of my Spirit upon all
flesh;</p>
<p class="pp1">And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</p>
<p class="pp1">And your young men shall see visions,</p>
<p class="pp1">And your old men shall dream dreams;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>18</sup>And even on my servants and on my
handmaids,</p>
<p class="pp1">I will pour out of my Spirit in those days,</p>
<p class="pp1">And they shall prophesy.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>19</sup>And I will show wonders in heaven
above,</p>
<p class="pp1">And signs in the earth beneath,</p>
<p class="pp1">Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>20</sup>The sun shall be turned into
darkness,</p>
<p class="pp1">And the moon into blood,</p>
<p class="pp1">Before the great and notable day of the Lord shall
come.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>21</sup>And it shall be, that every one who
shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus
the Nazarene, a man accredited to you from God by miracles, and
wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you,
as ye yourselves know; <sup>23</sup>this man, delivered up
according to the established counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye
slew, crucifying him by the hand of lawless ones; <sup>24</sup>whom
God raised up, having loosed the pains of death; because it was not
possible that he should be held by it. <sup>25</sup>For David says
concerning him:</p>
<p class="pp1">I saw the Lord always before me;</p>
<p class="pp1">Because he is on my right hand, that I should not be
moved.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>26</sup>For this my heart rejoiced, and my
tongue exulted;</p>
<p class="pp1">Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>27</sup>Because thou wilt not abandon my soul
to the underworld,</p>
<p class="pp1">Nor wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see
corruption.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>28</sup>Thou didst make known to me the ways of
life;</p>
<p class="pp1">Thou wilt make me full of joy with thy presence.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>29</sup>Men, brethren, I may speak freely to
you of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and
his sepulchre is among us unto this day. <sup>30</sup>Being a
prophet, therefore, and knowing that God swore to him, with an
oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit on his throne,
<sup>31</sup>he, foreseeing, spoke of the resurrection of the
Christ, that neither was his soul abandoned to the underworld, nor
did his flesh see corruption.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>This Jesus God raised up, whereof we
all are witnesses. <sup>33</sup>Being therefore exalted to the
right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise
of the Holy Spirit, he poured forth this, which ye now see and
hear. <sup>34</sup>For David did not ascend into heaven; but he
says himself:</p>
<p class="pp3">The Lord said to my Lord,</p>
<p class="pp3">Sit on my right hand,</p>
<p class="pp3"><sup>35</sup>Until I make thy foes thy
footstool.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>Therefore let all the house of Israel
know assuredly, that God made him, this Jesus whom ye crucified,
both Lord and Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>And hearing this, they were pierced to
the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: Men,
brethren, what shall we do? <sup>38</sup>And Peter said to them:
Repent, and be each of you immersed, upon the name of Jesus Christ,
unto remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit. <sup>39</sup>For the promise is to you, and to your
children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God
shall have called.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>And with many other words did he bear
witness and exhort, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse
generation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>They therefore, having
received<sup><a href="#r440241" id="f440241" title="see footnote"
name="f440241">41</a></sup> his word, were immersed and on that day
there were added about three thousand souls. <sup>42</sup>And they
were constantly attending on the teaching of the apostles, and the
distribution, and the breaking of bread, and prayers.
<sup>43</sup>And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and
signs were wrought through the apostles. <sup>44</sup>And all that
believed were together, and had all things common; <sup>45</sup>and
sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as
any one had need. <sup>46</sup>And daily attending with one accord
in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they partook
of food with gladness and singleness of heart,
<sup>47</sup>praising God, and having favor with all the people.
And the Lord added to the church daily those who are
saved<sup><a href="#r440247" id="f440247" title="see footnote"
name="f440247">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> Peter and
John were going up together into the temple at the hour of prayer,
being the ninth hour. <sup>2</sup>And a certain man lame from his
mother's womb was carried along, whom they laid daily at the gate
of the temple, the one called Beautiful, to ask alms of those
entering into the temple; <sup>3</sup>who, seeing Peter and John
about to go into the temple, asked alms. <sup>4</sup>And Peter,
looking intently upon him, with John, said: Look upon us.
<sup>5</sup>And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive
something from them. <sup>6</sup>And Peter said: Silver and gold
have I none; but what I have, that I give thee. In the name of
Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, rise up and walk. <sup>7</sup>And
seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up. And immediately
his feet and ankles received strength; <sup>8</sup>and leaping
forth, he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple,
walking, and leaping, and praising God. <sup>9</sup>And all the
people saw him walking and praising God; <sup>10</sup>and they
recognized him, that this was he who sat for alms at the beautiful
gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement
at that which had happened to him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And as he held fast to Peter and John,
all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called
Solomon's, greatly wondering. <sup>12</sup>And Peter, seeing it,
answered to the people: Men of Israel, why wonder ye at this? Or
why look ye so intently on us, as though by our own power or
godliness we had made this man to walk? <sup>13</sup>The God of
Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers,
glorified his servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him
in the presence of Pilate, when he decided to release him.
<sup>14</sup>But ye denied the Holy and Just, and demanded that a
murderer should be granted to you. <sup>15</sup>But the Author of
life ye killed; whom God raised from the dead, whereof we are
witnesses<sup><a href="#r440315" id="f440315" title="see footnote"
name="f440315">15</a></sup>. <sup>16</sup>And his name, upon the
faith in his name, made this man strong, whom ye see and know; and
the faith, which is through Him, gave him this perfect soundness in
the presence of you all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And now, brethren, I know that ye acted
in ignorance, as also your rulers. <sup>18</sup>But thus God
fulfilled what he before announced by the mouth of all his
prophets, that the Christ should suffer. <sup>19</sup>Repent
therefore, and turn, that your sins may be blotted out, in order
that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the
Lord; <sup>20</sup>and that he may send forth Jesus Christ, before
appointed for you; <sup>21</sup>whom the heavens, indeed, must
receive, until the times of the restoration of all things, which
God spoke of by the mouth of all his holy prophets from the
beginning. <sup>22</sup>Moses said: <span class="ot">A Prophet will
the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, like unto me;
him shall ye hear in all things whatever he shall say to
you.</span> <sup>23</sup><span class="ot">And it shall be that
every soul, that will not hear that Prophet, shall be utterly
destroyed from among the people.</span> <sup>24</sup>And also all
the prophets from Samuel, both he and they who followed, as many as
spoke, also foretold these days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the
covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham:
<span class="ot">And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
be blessed.</span> <sup>26</sup>Unto you first, God, having raised
up his servant Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every
one of you from your iniquities.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> while they
were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the
temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, <sup>2</sup>being
indignant because they taught the people, and announced in Jesus
the resurrection from the dead. <sup>3</sup>And they laid hands on
them, and put them in prison unto the morrow; for it was now
evening.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>But many of those who heard the word
believed; and the number of the men became about five thousand.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And it came to pass on the morrow, that
their rulers, and elders, and scribes, <sup>6</sup>and Annas the
high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as
were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together unto
Jerusalem. <sup>7</sup>And having set them in the midst, they
asked: By what power, or by what name, did ye do this?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit,
said to them: Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel;
<sup>9</sup>if we are this day examined in respect to a good deed
done to an impotent man, by what means this person has been made
whole; <sup>10</sup>be it known to you all, and to all the people
of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom ye
crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him does this man
stand here before you whole. <sup>11</sup>He is the stone that was
set at naught by you the builders, which is become the head of the
corner. <sup>12</sup>And there is salvation in no other; for
neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among
men, in which we must be saved.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And seeing the boldness of Peter and
John, and perceiving that they were unlearned and obscure men, they
wondered; and they recognized them, that they were with Jesus.
<sup>14</sup>And beholding the man who had been healed standing
with them, they had nothing to say against it. <sup>15</sup>But
having commanded them to go aside out of the council, they
conferred among themselves, <sup>16</sup>saying: What shall we do
to these men? For that a notorious miracle has been done by them is
manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem, and we are not able to
deny it. <sup>17</sup>But that it spread no further among the
people, let us strictly threaten them, that they speak henceforth
to no man in this name. <sup>18</sup>And having called them, they
commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach, in the name of
Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>But Peter and John answering said to
them: Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you
rather than to God, judge ye. <sup>20</sup>For we can not but speak
the things which we saw and heard.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And they, having further threatened
them, let them go, finding no way to punish them, on account of the
people, because all glorified God for that which was done;
<sup>22</sup>for the man was above forty years old, on whom this
sign of the healing had been wrought.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And being dismissed, they went to their
own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders
said to them. <sup>24</sup>And they, hearing it, lifted up their
voice to God with one accord, and said: Lord, thou art he who made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things in them;
<sup>25</sup>who by the mouth of thy servant David said:</p>
<p class="pp3">Why did the heathen rage<sup><a href="#r440425" id=
"f440425" title="see footnote" name="f440425">25</a></sup>,</p>
<p class="pp3">And the peoples imagine vain things?</p>
<p class="pp3"><sup>26</sup>The kings of the earth stood near,</p>
<p class="pp3">And the rulers assembled together,</p>
<p class="pp3">Against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>For in truth there assembled in this
city, against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both
Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the peoples of
Israel, <sup>28</sup>to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel before
determined to be done. <sup>29</sup>And now, Lord, behold their
threatenings; and grant to thy servants, that with all boldness
they may speak thy word, <sup>30</sup>by stretching forth thy hand
for healing, and that signs and wonders may be wrought through the
name of thy holy servant Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And when they had prayed, the place was
shaken where they were assembled; and they were all filled with the
Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And the multitude of those who believed
were of one heart and of one soul; and not one said that aught of
the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things
common. <sup>33</sup>And with great power the apostles gave the
testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace
was upon them all. <sup>34</sup>For there was no one among them
that lacked; for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold
them, and brought the prices of the things sold, <sup>35</sup>and
laid them at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to
each one, according as he had need.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And Joseph, who by the apostles was
surnamed Barnabas (which is interpreted, Son of consolation), a
Levite, born in Cyprus, <sup>37</sup>having land sold it, and
brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class=

sold a possession, <sup>2</sup>and kept back part of the price, his
wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid
it at the feet of the apostles. <sup>3</sup>But Peter said:
Ananias, why did Satan fill thy heart, that thou shouldst lie to
the Holy Spirit, and keep back part of the price of the land?
<sup>4</sup>While it remained, was it not thine own? And after it
was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why didst thou conceive
this thing in thy heart? Thou didst not lie to men, but to God.
<sup>5</sup>And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and expired;
and great fear came on all that heard these things. <sup>6</sup>And
the young men arose, wrapt him up, and carried him out<sup><a href=
"#r440506" id="f440506" title="see footnote" name=

<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And it was about the space of three
hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
<sup>8</sup>And Peter answered her: Tell me, whether ye sold the
land for so much? And she said: Yes, for so much. <sup>9</sup>And
Peter said to her: Why is it that ye agreed together to tempt the
Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who buried thy
husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. <sup>10</sup>And
immediately she fell at his feet, and expired; and coming in, the
young men found her dead, and carried her forth, and buried her by
her husband. <sup>11</sup>And great fear came upon all the church,
and upon all that heard these things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And by the hands of the apostles were
many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all
with one accord in Solomon's porch. <sup>13</sup>But of the rest no
one dared to join himself to them; but the people honored them;
<sup>14</sup>(and still more were believers added to the Lord,
multitudes both of men and women); <sup>15</sup>so that along the
streets they brought forth the sick, and laid them on beds and
pallets, that, as Peter was passing, the shadow at least might
overshadow some one of them. <sup>16</sup>And the multitude also of
the cities around came together to Jerusalem, bringing sick
persons, and those who were vexed by unclean spirits; and they were
all healed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>But the high priest rose up, and all
that were with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, and were
filled with indignation, <sup>18</sup>and laid their hands on the
apostles, and put them in the public prison.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>But an angel of the Lord by night
opened the prison doors; and having brought them forth, he said:
<sup>20</sup>Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all
the words of this life. <sup>21</sup>And hearing it, they went into
the temple at early dawn, and taught.</p>
<p class="pin">And the high priest came, and they that were with
him, and called the council together, and all the eldership of the
children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
<sup>22</sup>But the officers, when they came, found them not in
the prison; and returning, they reported, <sup>23</sup>saying: The
prison indeed we found shut with all security, and the keepers
standing without before the doors; but when we opened them, we
found no one within.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And when the priest and the captain of
the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they were at a
loss concerning them, to what this might grow. <sup>25</sup>But one
came and told them, saying: Behold, the men whom ye put in the
prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.
<sup>26</sup>Then went the captain with the officers, and brought
them, not with violence (for they feared the people), that they
might not be stoned. <sup>27</sup>And having brought them, they set
them before the council. And the high priest asked them,
<sup>28</sup>saying: Did we not strictly command you not to teach
in this name? And, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your
teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And Peter answering, and the apostles,
said: We ought to obey God rather than men. <sup>30</sup>The God of
our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.
<sup>31</sup>Him, as a prince and a Savior, did God exalt to his
right hand, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
<sup>32</sup>And we are his witnesses of these things, and the Holy
Spirit also, which God gave to those who obey him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And they, hearing it, were convulsed
with rage, and took counsel to slay them. <sup>34</sup>But there
stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher
of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the men
forth a little while; <sup>35</sup>and said to them: Men of Israel,
take heed to yourselves, what ye are about to do in respect to
these men. <sup>36</sup>For before these days arose Theudas,
boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about
four hundred, joined themselves; who was slain, and all, as many as
obeyed him, were scattered and brought to naught.
<sup>37</sup>After this man arose Judas the Galil&aelig;an, in the
days of the registering, and drew away much people after him; he
also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
<sup>38</sup>And now I say to you, refrain from these men, and let
them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will
come to naught; <sup>39</sup>but if it is of God ye can not
overthrow them; lest haply ye be found also fighting against
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>And to him they assented; and having
called the apostles, they scourged them, and commanded them not to
speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>They therefore went rejoicing from the
presence of the council, because for that name they were counted
worthy to suffer shame. <sup>42</sup>And every day, in the temple,
and from house to house, they ceased not to teach, and to publish
the glad tidings of Jesus the Christ.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> in these
days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose
a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their
widows were neglected in the daily ministration. <sup>2</sup>And
the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said:
It is not proper that we should leave the word of God, and serve
tables. <sup>3</sup>Therefore, brethren, look ye out among you
seven men of good repute, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom,
whom we will appoint over this business. <sup>4</sup>But we will
give ourselves to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And the saying pleased the whole
multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the
Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and
Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch, <sup>6</sup>whom they
set before the apostles; and having prayed, they laid their hands
on them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And the word of God increased; and the
number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a
great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And Stephen, full of grace and of power,
did great wonders and signs among the people. <sup>9</sup>And there
arose certain ones of the synagogue so called of the
Freedmen<sup><a href="#r440609" id="f440609" title="see footnote"
name="f440609">9</a></sup>, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of
those from Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.
<sup>10</sup>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the
spirit with which he spoke. <sup>11</sup>Then they suborned men,
who said: We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses,
and against God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And they stirred up the people, and the
elders, and the scribes; and coming upon him, they seized him, and
brought him to the council, <sup>13</sup>and set up false
witnesses, Who said: This man ceases not to speak words against
this holy place, and the law. <sup>14</sup>For we have heard him
say, that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and will
change the customs which Moses delivered to us. <sup>15</sup>And
all that sat in the council, looking intently upon him, saw his
face as the face of an angel.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> the high
priest said: Are then these things so? <sup>2</sup>And he said:
Brethren, and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared to our
father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in
Haran, <sup>3</sup>and said to him: Go forth from thy country, and
from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
<sup>4</sup>Then he went forth from the land of the
Chald&aelig;ans, and dwelt in Haran; and from thence, after his
father was dead, he caused him to remove into this land, wherein ye
now dwell. <sup>5</sup>And he gave him no inheritance in it, not
even a foot-breadth; and he promised to give it to him for a
possession, and to his seed after him, when he had no child.
<sup>6</sup>And God spoke after this manner, that his seed shall be
a sojourner in a strange land, and they will bring them into
bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.
<sup>7</sup><span class="ot">And the nation to whom they shall be
in bondage I will judge, said God; and after that they shall come
forth, and shall serve me in this place.</span> <sup>8</sup>And he
gave him the covenant of circumcision; and thus he begot Isaac, and
circumcised him the eighth day, and Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob the
twelve patriarchs. <sup>9</sup>And the patriarchs, moved with envy,
sold Joseph into Egypt. And God was with him, <sup>10</sup>and
delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and
wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him
governor over Egypt and all his house.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And there came a famine over all the
land of Egypt and Canaan, and a great affliction; and our fathers
found no sustenance. <sup>12</sup>But Jacob, hearing that there was
grain in Egypt, first sent out our fathers. <sup>13</sup>And at the
second time, Joseph was recognized by his brothers; and the race of
Joseph was made known to Pharaoh. <sup>14</sup>Then Joseph sent,
and called for Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore
and fifteen souls. <sup>15</sup>And Jacob went down into Egypt, and
died, he and our fathers, <sup>16</sup>and were removed to Shechem,
and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the
sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>But as the time of the promise drew
near, which God declared to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied
in Egypt, <sup>18</sup>until another king arose who knew not
Joseph. <sup>19</sup>He, dealing subtly with our race, afflicted
our fathers, so that they should cast out their infants, that they
might not be preserved alive. <sup>20</sup>In which time Moses was
born, and was exceeding fair<sup><a href="#r440720" id="f440720"
title="see footnote" name="f440720">20</a></sup>, who was nourished
three months in his father's house. <sup>21</sup>And when he was
cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for
herself as a son.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And Moses was instructed in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
<sup>23</sup>And when he was forty years old, it came into his
heart to visit his brethren the sons of Israel. <sup>24</sup>And
seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged the
one oppressed by smiting the Egyptian. <sup>25</sup>For he supposed
his brethren would understand, that God by his hand would deliver
them; but they understood not. <sup>26</sup>And on the following
day he showed himself to them as they were contending, and urged
them to peace, saying: <span class="ot">Ye are brethren; why wrong
ye one another?</span> <sup>27</sup>But he who was wronging his
neighbor thrust him away, saying: <span class="ot">Who made thee a
ruler and a judge over us?</span> <sup>28</sup><span class=
"ot">Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian
yesterday?</span> <sup>29</sup>And Moses fled at this saying, and
became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.
<sup>30</sup>And when forty years were completed, there appeared to
him in the wilderness of the mount Sinai an angel in a flame of
fire, in a bush. <sup>31</sup>And Moses, seeing it, wondered at the
sight; and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came
to him, saving: <sup>32</sup><span class="ot">I am the God of thy
fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob.</span> And Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
<sup>33</sup>And the Lord said to him: <span class="ot">Loose the
sandals from thy feet; for the place where thou standest is holy
ground.</span> <sup>34</sup><span class="ot">Truly, I saw the
affliction of my people in Egypt, and I heard their groaning, and
came down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into
Egypt.</span> <sup>35</sup>This Moses whom they denied, saying:
<span class="ot">Who made thee a ruler and a judge?</span> him did
God send as a ruler and a redeemer by the hand<sup><a href=
"#r440735" id="f440735" title="see footnote" name=
"f440735">35</a></sup> of the angel who appeared to him in the
bush. <sup>36</sup>He brought them out, working wonders and signs
in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness
forty years.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>This is the Moses who said to the
children of Israel: <span class="ot">A Prophet will God raise up to
you of your brethren, like unto.</span> <sup>38</sup>This is he who
was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke
to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers; who received the
living oracles to give to us; <sup>39</sup>to whom our fathers
would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and in their
hearts turned back again into Egypt, <sup>40</sup>saying to Aaron:
<span class="ot">Make us gods who shall go before us; for as for
this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not
what is become of him.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>41</sup>And they made a calf in those days, and
offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their
own hands. <sup>42</sup>And God turned away, and gave them up to
worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the
prophets:</p>
<p class="pp1">Did ye offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices,</p>
<p class="pp1">Forty years in the wilderness, O house of
Israel?</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>43</sup>And ye took up the tabernacle of
Moloch,</p>
<p class="pp1">And the star of the god Remphan,</p>
<p class="pp1">The figures which ye made to worship them;</p>
<p class="pp1">And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>Our fathers had the tabernacle of the
testimony in the wilderness, as he who spoke to Moses commanded,
that he should make it according to the pattern that he had seen;
<sup>45</sup>which also our fathers received, and brought in with
Joshua into the possession of the heathen, whom God drove out
before our fathers, unto the days of David; <sup>46</sup>who found
favor before God, and asked that he might find a habitation for the
God of Jacob. <sup>47</sup>But Solomon built a house for him.
<sup>48</sup>Yet the Most High dwells not in temples made with
hands; as says the prophet:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>49</sup>Heaven is my throne,</p>
<p class="pp1">And the earth is my footstool.</p>
<p class="pp1">What house will ye build for me, saith the Lord;</p>
<p class="pp1">Or what is my place of rest?</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>50</sup>Did not my hand make all these
things?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>51</sup>Stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in
heart and ears! Ye always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers
did, so do ye. <sup>52</sup>Which of the prophets did not your
fathers persecute? And they slew those who announced beforehand
concerning the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have now become
the betrayers and murderers; <sup>53</sup>who received the law as
the ordinances of angels, and kept it not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>54</sup>Hearing these things, they were enraged
in their hearts, and gnashed their teeth against him.
<sup>55</sup>But, being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked intently
into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the
right hand of God, and said: <sup>56</sup>Behold, I see the heavens
opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
<sup>57</sup>And crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their
ears, and rushed upon him with one accord; <sup>58</sup>and having
cast him out of the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid
off their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul,
<sup>59</sup>and stoned Stephen, calling and saying: Lord Jesus,
receive my spirit. <sup>60</sup>And kneeling down, he cried with a
loud voice: Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And saying
this, he fell asleep.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> Saul was
consenting to his death. And on that day there arose a great
persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and all were
scattered abroad throughout the regions of Jud&aelig;a and Samaria,
except the apostles. <sup>2</sup>And devout men carried Stephen to
his burial, and made great lamentation over him. <sup>3</sup>But
Saul laid waste the church, entering house after house, and
dragging both men and women, committed them to prison.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>They, therefore, that were scattered,
went abroad, preaching the word. <sup>5</sup>And Philip went down
to the city<sup><a href="#r440805" id="f440805" title=
"see footnote" name="f440805">5</a></sup> of Samaria, and preached
to them the Christ. <sup>6</sup>And the multitudes with one accord
gave heed to the things said by Philip, when they heard, and saw
the signs which he wrought. <sup>7</sup>For out of many who had
unclean spirits they went forth, crying with loud voice; and many
that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed. <sup>8</sup>And
there was great joy in that city.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>But a certain man, named Simon, was in
the city before, using sorcery, and bewitching the people of
Samaria, saying that he was some great one; <sup>10</sup>to whom
all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is
the great power of God<sup><a href="#r440810" id="f440810" title=
"see footnote" name="f440810">10</a></sup>. <sup>11</sup>And to him
they gave heed, because for a long time they were bewitched by his
sorceries. <sup>12</sup>But when they believed Philip publishing
the good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
Christ, they were immersed, both men and women. <sup>13</sup>And
Simon also himself believed; and having been immersed, he continued
with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which
were wrought.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And the apostles in Jerusalem, hearing
that Samaria has received the word of God, sent to them Peter and
John; <sup>15</sup>who, having come down, prayed for them, that
they might receive the Holy Spirit; <sup>16</sup>for he had not yet
fallen upon any of them; but they had only been immersed in the
name of the Lord Jesus. <sup>17</sup>Then they laid their hands on
them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And Simon, seeing that through the
laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, offered
them money, <sup>19</sup>saying: Give me also this power, that on
whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
<sup>20</sup>But Peter said to him: Thy money perish with thee;
because thou didst think to obtain the gift of God with money:
<sup>21</sup>Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter<sup><a href=
"#r440821" id="f440821" title="see footnote" name=
"f440821">21</a></sup>; for thy heart is not right in the sight of
God. <sup>22</sup>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray
the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven
thee. <sup>23</sup>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of
bitterness, and the bond of iniquity.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And Simon answering, said: Pray ye to
the Lord for me, that none of the things which ye have spoken come
upon me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>They, therefore, having testified and
spoken the word of the Lord, were returning to Jerusalem, and
publishing the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.
<sup>26</sup>But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying:
Arise, and go down to the south, to the way that goes down from
Jerusalem to Gaza. This is desert.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And he arose and went. And behold, a
man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, an officer of state of Candace queen of
the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, and had come to
Jerusalem to worship, <sup>28</sup>was returning, and sitting in
his chariot; and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
<sup>29</sup>And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join
thyself to this chariot. <sup>30</sup>And Philip ran thither, and
heard him reading Isaiah the prophet. And he said: Understandest
thou then what thou art reading? <sup>31</sup>And he said: How
could I, except some one should guide me? And he entreated Philip
to come up, and sit with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And the contents of the Scripture which
he was reading was this:</p>
<p class="pp1">He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;</p>
<p class="pp1">And as a lamb dumb before his shearer,</p>
<p class="pp1">So he opens not his mouth.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>33</sup>In his humiliation his judgment was
taken away;</p>
<p class="pp1">And his generation<sup><a href="#r440833" id=
"f440833" title="see footnote" name="f440833">33</a></sup> who
shall fully declare?</p>
<p class="pp1">For his life is taken away from the earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>And the eunuch answering said to
Philip: I pray thee, of whom does the prophet speak this? Of
himself, or of some other man? <sup>35</sup>And Philip opened his
mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, made known to him the
good news of Jesus. <sup>36</sup>And as they went along the way,
they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said: See, here is
water; what hinders that I should be immersed?
<sup>37</sup><sup><a href="#r440837" id="f440837" title=
"see footnote" name="f440837">37</a></sup>And Philip said: If thou
believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And answering he said: I
believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. <sup>38</sup>And he
commanded that the chariot should stop. And they went down both
into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he immersed him.
<sup>39</sup>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of
the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he
went on his way rejoicing. <sup>40</sup>But Philip was found at
Azotus; and passing through, he published the good news to all the
cities, till he came to C&aelig;sarea.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class="sc">ut</span> Saul, yet
breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the
Lord, went to the high priest, <sup>2</sup>and asked of him letters
to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way,
whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And as he journeyed, he came near
Damascus. And suddenly there flashed around him a light from
heaven; <sup>4</sup>and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice
saying to him: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <sup>5</sup>And
he said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said: I am Jesus, whom
thou persecutest. <sup>6</sup>But arise, and go into the city, and
it shall be told thee what thou must do.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And the men who journeyed with him were
standing speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.
<sup>8</sup>And Saul arose from the earth; and his eyes being
opened, he saw nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought
him into Damascus. <sup>9</sup>And he was three days without sight,
and neither ate nor drank.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And there was a certain disciple at
Damascus, named Ananias; and to him the Lord said, in a vision,
Ananias! And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. <sup>11</sup>And the
Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the street which is called
Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of
Tarsus. For, behold, he prays; <sup>12</sup>and in a vision he saw
a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he
might receive sight.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And Ananias answered: Lord, I have
heard from many concerning this man, how great evils he did to thy
saints at Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>And here he has authority from
the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
<sup>15</sup>But the Lord said to him: Go; for he is to me a chosen
vessel, to bear my name before Gentiles, and kings, and the sons of
Israel; <sup>16</sup>for I will show him how great things he must
suffer for my name's sake. <sup>17</sup>And Ananias went, and
entered into the house; and putting his hands on him, he said:
Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me, Jesus who appeared to thee in
the way thou camest, that thou mayest receive sight, and be filled
with the Holy Spirit. <sup>18</sup>And immediately there fell off
from his eyes as it were scales; and he received sight, and arose,
and was immersed; <sup>19</sup>and having taken food, he was
strengthened.</p>
<p class="pin">And Saul was certain days with the disciples at
Damascus. <sup>20</sup>And straightway he preached Jesus, in the
synagogues, that he is the Son of God. <sup>21</sup>And all that
heard him were amazed, and said: Is not this he who destroyed in
Jerusalem those who call on this name? And he came hither for this
purpose, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>But Saul was more strengthened, and
confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the
Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And when many days were completed, the
Jews took counsel to kill him. <sup>24</sup>But their lying in wait
became known to Saul. And they were watching the gates day and
night to kill him. <sup>25</sup>But the disciples took him by
night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a
basket.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>And Saul, having come to Jerusalem,
attempted to join himself to the disciples; and all were afraid of
him, not believing that he was a disciple. <sup>27</sup>But
Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and related
fully to them how he saw the Lord in the way, and that he spoke to
him, and how he preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
<sup>28</sup>And he was with them, going in and out at Jerusalem,
<sup>29</sup>and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus; and
was speaking and disputing against the Grecian Jews; but they were
attempting to slay him. <sup>30</sup>And the brethren, learning it,
brought him down to C&aelig;sarea, and sent him forth to
Tarsus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>The church therefore, throughout all
Jud&aelig;a and Galilee and Samaria, had peace, being built up, and
walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the consolation of the Holy
Spirit, was multiplied.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And it came to pass that Peter, going
through them all, came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.
<sup>33</sup>And there he found a certain man named &AElig;neas,
who had lain upon a pallet eight years, who was palsied.
<sup>34</sup>And Peter said to him: &AElig;neas, Jesus the Christ
makes thee whole; arise, and make thy bed. And immediately he
arose. <sup>35</sup>And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him;
and they turned to the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And there was at Joppa a certain
disciple named Tabitha, which interpreted is called Dorcas. This
woman was full of good works, and of alms, which she did.
<sup>37</sup>And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick,
and died. And having washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
<sup>38</sup>And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, having
heard that Peter was there, sent to him two men, entreating that he
would not delay to come to them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And Peter arose and went with them.
When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber; and all
the widows stood by him weeping, and showing coats and garments
which Dorcas made, while she was with them. <sup>40</sup>But Peter
put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to
the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and
seeing Peter, she sat up. <sup>41</sup>And he gave her his hand,
and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented
her alive. <sup>42</sup>And it became known throughout all Joppa;
and many believed on the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>43</sup>And it came to pass, that he remained
many days in Joppa, with one Simon, a tanner.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class=
"sc">here</span> was a certain man in C&aelig;sarea named
Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band;
<sup>2</sup>devout, and one that feared God with all his house,
giving many alms to the people, and praying to God always.
<sup>3</sup>He saw in a vision, distinctly, about the ninth hour of
the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him:
Cornelius! <sup>4</sup>And fixing his eyes on him, he was afraid,
and said: What is it, Lord? And he said to him: Thy prayers and
thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. <sup>5</sup>And
now send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter.
<sup>6</sup>He lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by
the seaside.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And when the angel who spoke to
Cornelius was gone, he called two of his household servants, and a
devout soldier of those who waited on him; <sup>8</sup>and having
told them all these things, he sent them to Joppa.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>On the morrow, as they were journeying,
and drawing near to the city, Peter went up upon the house-top to
pray, about the sixth hour. <sup>10</sup>And he became very hungry,
and desired to eat. While they now were making ready, there fell
upon him a trance; <sup>11</sup>and he beholds heaven opened, and a
certain vessel descending upon him, as a great sheet, bound by four
corners, and let down upon the earth; <sup>12</sup>wherein were all
the fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth, and birds
of the air. <sup>13</sup>And there came a voice to him: Arise,
Peter; slay, and eat. <sup>14</sup>But Peter said: Not so, Lord;
for I never ate anything common or unclean. <sup>15</sup>And a
voice came to him again, the second time: What God cleansed, call
not thou common. <sup>16</sup>This was done thrice; and the vessel
was taken up again into heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And while Peter was doubting in himself
what the vision might be which he saw, behold, the men who were
sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, came
and stood before the gate; <sup>18</sup>and calling they asked,
whether Simon, who is surnamed Peter, lodges here.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>While Peter was earnestly considering
the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold, men are seeking thee.
<sup>20</sup>But arise, and go down, and go with them, making no
scruple; because I have sent them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Peter went down to the men, and said:
Behold, I am he whom ye seek. What is the cause for which ye are
here? <sup>22</sup>And they said: Cornelius, a centurion, a just
man, and one that fears God, and of good report among all the
nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for
thee to his house; and to hear words from thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>He called them in, therefore, and
lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went forth with them, and
certain brethren from Joppa went with him. <sup>24</sup>And on the
morrow after, they entered into C&aelig;sarea. And Cornelius was
expecting them, having called together his kinsmen and near
friends. <sup>25</sup>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met
him, and fell down at his feet, and did reverence to him.
<sup>26</sup>But Peter raised him, saying: Stand up; I myself also
am a man. <sup>27</sup>And while talking with him, he went in, and
found many that were come together. <sup>28</sup>And he said to
them: Ye know that it is unlawful<sup><a href="#r441028" id=
"f441028" title="see footnote" name="f441028">28</a></sup> for a
Jew to keep company with, or come to, one of another nation; but
God showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
<sup>29</sup>Wherefore I also came without delay, when sent for. I
ask therefore for what reason did ye send for me?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And Cornelius said: Four days ago I was
fasting unto this hour, and at the ninth hour was praying in my
house; and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
<sup>31</sup>and said: Cornelius, thy prayer was heard, and thine
alms were remembered before God. <sup>32</sup>Send therefore to
Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodges in the
house of Simon a tanner, by the sea-side; who, when he comes will
speak to thee. <sup>33</sup>Immediately therefore I sent to thee;
and thou didst well in coming hither. Now therefore we are all
present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee from
the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>And Peter opened his mouth, and said:
Of a truth I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons;
<sup>35</sup>but in every nation he that fears him, and works
righteousness, is acceptable to him. <sup>36</sup>The word which he
sent to the sons of Israel, publishing glad tidings of peace
through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), <sup>37</sup>ye know; the
thing which was done throughout all Jud&aelig;a, beginning from
Galilee, after the immersion which John preached; Jesus of
Nazareth, <sup>38</sup>how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit
and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that
were oppressed by the Devil; because God was with him.
<sup>39</sup>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both
in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew,
hanging him on a tree. <sup>40</sup>Him God raised on the third
day, and showed him openly; <sup>41</sup>not to all the people, but
to witnesses before appointed by God, to us, who ate and drank with
him after he rose from the dead. <sup>42</sup>And he commanded us
to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who has been
appointed by God to be Judge of the living and dead.
<sup>43</sup>To him all the prophets bear witness, that through his
name every one who believes on him shall receive remission of
sins.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>While Peter was yet speaking these
words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.
<sup>45</sup>And those of the circumcision who believed, as many as
came with Peter, were astonished, that on the Gentiles also was
poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup>46</sup>For they heard
them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God.</p>
<p class="pin">Then answered Peter: <sup>47</sup>Can any one forbid
the water, that these should not be immersed, who received the Holy
Spirit even as we also? <sup>48</sup>And he commanded that they
should be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they entreated him
to remain certain days.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> the
apostles, and the brethren throughout Jud&aelig;a, heard that the
Gentiles also received the word of God. <sup>2</sup>And when Peter
went up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended
with him, <sup>3</sup>saying: Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised,
and didst eat with them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>But Peter rehearsed the matter to them
in order, from the beginning, saying: <sup>5</sup>I was in the city
of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel
descending, as a great sheet, let down out of heaven by four
corners; and it came even to me. <sup>6</sup>On which fixing my
eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and
wild beasts, and creeping things, and birds of the air.
<sup>7</sup>And I heard a voice saying to me: Arise, Peter; slay
and eat. <sup>8</sup>But I said: Not so, Lord; for nothing common
or unclean ever entered into my mouth. <sup>9</sup>But a voice
answered me a second time out of heaven: What God cleansed, regard
not thou as common. <sup>10</sup>And this was done three times; and
all were drawn up again into heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And, behold, immediately there stood
three men at the house where I was, having been sent to me from
C&aelig;sarea. <sup>12</sup>And the Spirit bade me go with them,
making no scruple. And these six brethren also went with me, and we
entered into the man's house. <sup>13</sup>And he told us how he
saw the angel in his house, standing and saying to him: Send to
Joppa, and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter; <sup>14</sup>who
will speak to thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, and all thy
house.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And as I began to speak, the Holy
Spirit fell on them, as also on us at the beginning;
<sup>16</sup>and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said:
John indeed immersed in water, but ye shall be immersed in the Holy
Spirit. <sup>17</sup>If therefore God gave the like gift to them as
to us, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who then was I,
that I could withstand God?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>When they heard these things, they held
their peace, and glorified God, saying: So then, to the Gentiles
also God gave repentance unto life.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Now they who were scattered abroad by
the persecution that arose on account of Stephen, went as far as
Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none but
Jews. <sup>20</sup>But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene,
who, having come to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, publishing the
good news of the Lord Jesus. <sup>21</sup>And the hand of the Lord
was with them; and a great number believed, and turned to the
Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>But the report concerning them came to
the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem; and they sent forth
Barnabas, to go as far as Antioch. <sup>23</sup>Who having come,
and seen the grace of God, rejoiced; and he exhorted all, that with
purpose of heart they should cleave to the Lord. <sup>24</sup>For
he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a
great multitude was added to the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And Barnabas departed to Tarsus, to
seek for Saul; <sup>26</sup>and having found him, he brought him to
Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they came together
in the church, and taught a great multitude; and the disciples were
first called Christians in Antioch.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And in these days prophets came down
from Jerusalem to Antioch. <sup>28</sup>And there stood up one of
them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be
a great dearth over all the world; which came to pass in the days
of Claudius C&aelig;sar. <sup>29</sup>And the disciples, according
as any one was prospered, determined each of them to send relief to
the brethren dwelling in Jud&aelig;a; <sup>30</sup>which also they
did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and
Saul.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> about that
time, Herod the king stretched forth his hands to
oppress<sup><a href="#r441201" id="f441201" title="see footnote"
name="f441201">1</a></sup> certain of the church. <sup>2</sup>And
he slew James the brother of John with the sword. <sup>3</sup>And
seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter
also; (then were the days of unleavened bread;) <sup>4</sup>whom he
also seized and put in prison, delivering him to four quaternions
of soldiers to keep him; intending after the passover to bring him
forth to the people.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Peter therefore was kept guarded in the
prison; but earnest prayer was made by the church to God on his
behalf.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And when Herod was about to bring him
forth, in that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound
with two chains; and keepers before the door were guarding the
prison. <sup>7</sup>And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him,
and a light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side,
and raised him, saying: Rise up quickly. And his chains fell from
off his hands. <sup>8</sup>And the angel said to him: Gird thyself,
and bind on thy sandals; and he did so. And he said to him: Cast
thy garment about thee, and follow me. <sup>9</sup>And he went out,
and followed him; and knew not that what was done by the angel was
true, but thought he saw a vision.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And having passed the first and the
second watch, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city,
which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out, and
passed on through one street, and immediately the angel departed
from him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And Peter, having come to himself,
said: Now I know truly, that the Lord sent forth his angel, and
delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation
of the people of the Jews. <sup>12</sup>And becoming fully
conscious of it, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John,
who was surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together, and
praying.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And as Peter knocked at the door of the
gate, a maidservant came to hearken, named Rhoda.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And recognizing Peter's voice, she
opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told that Peter
was standing before the gate. <sup>15</sup>And they said to her:
Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And
they said: It is his angel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>But Peter continued knocking; and
opening the door they saw him, and were amazed. <sup>17</sup>And
beckoning to them with the hand to be silent, he related to them
how the Lord brought him out of the prison. And he said: Go tell
these things to James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and
went to another place.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And when it was day, there was no small
commotion among the soldiers, as to what was become of Peter.
<sup>19</sup>And Herod, when he had sought for him, and found him
not, after examining the keepers, commanded that they should be led
away to death. And he went down from Jud&aelig;a to C&aelig;sarea,
and there abode.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And Herod was highly displeased with
the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came with one accord to him,
and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend,
desired peace; because their country was nourished by that of the
king.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And on a set day Herod, arrayed in
royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made a speech to them.
<sup>22</sup>And thereupon the people shouted: The voice of a god,
and not of a man! <sup>23</sup>And immediately an angel of the Lord
smote him, because he gave not glory to God; and he was eaten by
worms, and expired.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>But the word of God grew and
multiplied. <sup>25</sup>And Barnabas and Saul returned from
Jerusalem, having performed the service, taking with them also
John, who was surnamed Mark.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> there
were at Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and
teachers; Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the
Cyrenean, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and
Saul.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And while they were ministering to the
Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said: Set apart for me Barnabas
and Saul, unto the work to which I have called them.
<sup>3</sup>Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
them, they sent them away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>They therefore, being sent forth by the
Holy Spirit, came down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed
away to Cyprus. <sup>5</sup>And having come to Salamis, they
preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they
had also John as an assistant.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And having gone through the island to
Paphos, they found a certain Magian, a Jewish false prophet, whose
name was Bar-jesus; <sup>7</sup>who was with the proconsul of the
country, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. He, having called for
Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God. <sup>8</sup>But
Elymas the Magian (for so his name is interpreted), withstood them,
seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Then Saul (who is also called Paul),
filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him,
<sup>10</sup>and said: O full of all deceit and all wickedness,
child of the Devil, enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease
to pervert the right ways of the Lord? <sup>11</sup>And now,
behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind,
not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him
a mist and darkness; and going about, he sought persons to lead him
by the hand.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Then the proconsul, seeing what was
done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And Paul and his companions, having put
to sea from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John departing
from them returned to Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup>But they, going on
from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia; and entering into the
synagogue on the sabbath day, they sat down. <sup>15</sup>And after
the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the
synagogue sent to them, saying: Men, brethren, if ye have any word
of exhortation for the people, speak.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And Paul arose, and beckoning with the
hand, said: Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken.
<sup>17</sup>The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers;
and he exalted the people in their sojourn in the land of Egypt,
and with a high arm he brought them out of it. <sup>18</sup>And
about the time of forty years he nourished them<sup><a href=
"#r441318" id="f441318" title="see footnote" name=
"f441318">18</a></sup> in the wilderness. <sup>19</sup>And having
destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their
land as a possession, <sup>20</sup>about four hundred and fifty
years. And after that, he gave judges, until Samuel the prophet.
<sup>21</sup>And afterward they desired a king; and God gave them
Saul the Son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty
years. <sup>22</sup>And having removed him, he raised up for them
David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, saying:
<span class="ot">I found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own
heart, who will do all my will.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>Of the seed of this man, God, according
to promise, raised up to Israel a Savior, Jesus; <sup>24</sup>John
having first preached, before his entrance, the immersion of
repentance to all the people of Israel. <sup>25</sup>Now as John
was finishing his course, he said: Whom do ye suppose me to be? I
am not he. But, behold, there comes one after me, the sandal of
whose feet I am not worthy to loose.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>Men, brethren, children of the race of
Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you the word of this
salvation was sent forth. <sup>27</sup>For they who dwell at
Jerusalem, and their rulers, not knowing him, nor the voices of the
prophets which are read every sabbath day, fulfilled them in
condemning him. <sup>28</sup>And though they found no cause of
death, they demanded of Pilate that he should be slain.
<sup>29</sup>And when they had fulfilled all the things written of
him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.
<sup>30</sup>But God raised him from the dead. <sup>31</sup>And he
was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee
to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people.
<sup>32</sup>And we declare to you glad tidings of the promise made
to the fathers, <sup>33</sup>that God has fulfilled this to us
their children, in raising Jesus; as also it is written in the
second psalm<sup><a href="#r441333" id="f441333" title=
"see footnote" name="f441333">33</a></sup>:</p>
<p class="pp4">Thou art my Son;</p>
<p class="pp4">I this day have begotten thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>And that he raised him up from the dead
to return no more to corruption, he has thus spoken: <span class=
"ot">I will give to you the holy, the sure promises of
David.</span> <sup>35</sup>Wherefore also in another psalm he says:
<span class="ot">Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see
corruption.</span> <sup>36</sup>For David, having served his own
generation according to the purpose of God, fell asleep, and was
added to his fathers, and saw corruption. <sup>37</sup>But he, whom
God raised, saw not corruption.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>Be it known to you therefore, men,
brethren, that remission of sins through this man is announced to
you; <sup>39</sup>and by him all that believe are justified from
all things, from which ye were not able to be justified by the law
of Moses.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>Beware therefore, lest that come upon
you, which is spoken in the prophets:</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>41</sup>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and
perish;</p>
<p class="pp2">Because I work a work in your days,</p>
<p class="pp2">A work which ye will not believe,</p>
<p class="pp2">Though one should fully declare it to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>42</sup>And as they were going out, they
besought that these words might be spoken to them on the next
sabbath. <sup>43</sup>And when the congregation was broken up, many
of the Jews and of the proselyte worshipers followed Paul and
Barnabas; who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the
grace of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>44</sup>And on the next sabbath day, almost the
whole city came together to hear the word of God. <sup>45</sup>But
the Jews, seeing the multitudes, were filled with indignation, and
spoke against the things said by Paul, contradicting and
blaspheming.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>46</sup>Then Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly,
and said: It was necessary that the word of God should first be
spoken to you; but since ye thrust it from you, and judge
yourselves not worthy of the eternal life, lo, we turn to the
Gentiles. <sup>47</sup>For so has the Lord commanded us:</p>
<p class="pp1">I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles,</p>
<p class="pp1">That thou shouldst be for salvation to the end of
the earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>48</sup>And the Gentiles hearing it rejoiced,
and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were appointed
unto eternal life believed. <sup>49</sup>And the word of the Lord
was spread abroad throughout all the region.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>50</sup>But the Jews stirred up the devout and
honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised
persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out from
their borders. <sup>51</sup>And they, having shaken off the dust of
their feet against them, came to Iconium. <sup>52</sup>And the
disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> it came to
pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the
Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of Jews and Greeks
believed. <sup>2</sup>But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up and
embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.
<sup>3</sup>They spent a long time, therefore, speaking boldly in
the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting
signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>But the multitude of the city was
divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
<sup>5</sup>And when a movement was made, both of the Gentiles and
Jews with their rulers, to abuse and stone them, <sup>6</sup>they,
being aware of it, fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and
Derbe, and the region around; <sup>7</sup>and there they were
publishing the good news.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And there sat a certain man at Lystra,
impotent in his feet, being lame from his mother's womb, who never
walked. <sup>9</sup>This man was listening to Paul as he spoke;
who, fixing his eyes on him, and perceiving that he had faith to be
healed, <sup>10</sup>said with a loud voice: Stand upright on thy
feet. And he leaped up, and walked.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And the multitudes, seeing what Paul
did, lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia: The
gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. <sup>12</sup>And
they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was
the chief speaker. <sup>13</sup>And the priest of Jupiter, that was
before the city, having brought oxen and garlands to the gates,
would have offered sacrifice with the people. <sup>14</sup>But the
apostles, Barnabas and Paul, hearing of it, rent their clothes, and
rushed forth to the multitude; crying out, <sup>15</sup>and saying:
Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like nature with
you, bringing you glad tidings, that ye should turn from these
vanities to the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the
sea, and all things that are therein; <sup>16</sup>who, in the ages
past, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways;
<sup>17</sup>although he left not himself without witness, in that
he did good, giving you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
filling your hearts with food and gladness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And with these sayings they hardly
restrained the people from sacrificing to them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>But there came thither Jews from
Antioch and Iconium; and having persuaded the people, and stoned
Paul, they drew him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
<sup>20</sup>But the disciples having gathered around him, he rose
up, and came into the city; and on the morrow he departed with
Barnabas to Derbe. <sup>21</sup>And having published the good news
to that city, and made many disciples, they turned back to Lystra,
and Iconium, and Antioch; <sup>22</sup>confirming the souls of the
disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we
must through much affliction enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And having appointed for them elders in
every church, they commended them, with prayer and fasting, to the
Lord, on whom they believed. <sup>24</sup>And after passing through
Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. <sup>25</sup>And having spoken the
word in Perga, they went down to Attalia; <sup>26</sup>and thence
they sailed away to Antioch, from whence they had been commended to
the grace of God for the work which they accomplished.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And having come, and gathered the
church together, they reported how great things God wrought with
them, and that he opened to the Gentiles a door of faith.
<sup>28</sup>And they spent no little time with the disciples.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> certain
men, coming down from Jud&aelig;a, taught the brethren: Except ye
are circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye can not be saved.
<sup>2</sup>Paul and Barnabas having therefore had no little
dissension and discussion with them, they determined that Paul and
Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go up to Jerusalem to
the apostles and elders, about this question.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>They therefore, having been sent forward
by the church, passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the
conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the
brethren. <sup>4</sup>And having come to Jerusalem, they were
gladly received by the church, and the apostles and elders; and
they reported how great things God wrought with them.
<sup>5</sup>But there arose some of those from the sect of the
Pharisees who believed, saying: It is necessary to circumcise them,
and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And the apostles and the elders came
together to consider this matter. <sup>7</sup>And when there had
been much discussion, Peter arose, and said to them: Men, brethren,
ye know that a long time ago God made choice among us, that by my
mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the glad tidings and
believe. <sup>8</sup>And God who knows the heart bore them witness,
giving to them the Holy Spirit, as also to us; <sup>9</sup>and made
no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by
faith.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Now therefore why do ye tempt God, by
putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our
fathers nor we were able to bear? <sup>11</sup>But, through the
grace of the Lord Jesus, we believe that we shall be saved, in the
same manner as they also.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And all the multitude became silent,
and listened to Barnabas and Paul, narrating how great signs and
wonders God wrought among the Gentiles through them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And after they were silent, James
answered, saying: Men, brethren, hearken to me. <sup>14</sup>Simeon
narrated how at first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them
a people for his name. <sup>15</sup>And with this agree the words
of the prophets; as it is written:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>16</sup>After this I will return,</p>
<p class="pp1">And will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is
fallen down;</p>
<p class="pp1">And I will rebuild the ruins thereof, and will set
it up again;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>17</sup>that the rest of men may seek after the
Lord,</p>
<p class="pp1">And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name has been
called,</p>
<p class="pp1">Saith the Lord, who does these things<sup><a href=
"#r441517" id="f441517" title="see footnote" name=
"f441517">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Known to God are all his works from the
beginning of the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Wherefore my judgment is, that we
trouble not those who from among the Gentiles are turning to God;
<sup>20</sup>but that we write to them, that they abstain from
pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is
strangled, and from blood. <sup>21</sup>For Moses of old time has
in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues
every sabbath.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>Then the apostles and the elders, with
the whole church, resolved, having chosen men from themselves, to
send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed
Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.
<sup>23</sup>And they wrote by them thus:</p>
<p class="pin">The apostles and the elders and the brethren, to the
brethren from the Gentiles throughout Antioch and Syria and
Cilicia, greeting: <sup>24</sup>Forasmuch as we heard, that some
who went out from us troubled you with words, subverting your
souls, saying that ye must be circumcised and keep the
law<sup><a href="#r441524" id="f441524" title="see footnote" name=
"f441524">24</a></sup>, to whom we gave no commandment;
<sup>25</sup>it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to
choose men and send them to you, with our beloved Barnabas and
Paul, <sup>26</sup>men who have hazarded their lives for the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas,
who will themselves also by word tell you the same things.
<sup>28</sup>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to
lay upon you no further burden except these necessary things;
<sup>29</sup>that ye abstain from things offered to idols, and from
blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication; from which
if ye keep yourselves, ye will do well. Farewell.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>They therefore, being dismissed, came
to Antioch; and assembling the multitude they delivered the letter.
<sup>31</sup>And having read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.
<sup>32</sup>And Judas and Silas, also themselves being prophets,
exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And having remained a while, they were
dismissed with peace from the brethren to the apostles.
<sup>34</sup>But it pleased Silas to abide there still<sup><a href=
"#r441534" id="f441534" title="see footnote" name=
"f441534">34</a></sup>. <sup>35</sup>Paul also and Barnabas
continued in Antioch, teaching and publishing the glad tidings of
the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And some days after, Paul said to
Barnabas: Let us return now, and visit the brethren in every city
where we preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
<sup>37</sup>And Barnabas determined to take with them John, who
was surnamed Mark. <sup>38</sup>But Paul thought it proper not to
take with them him who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went
not with them to the work. <sup>39</sup>And there arose a sharp
contention, so that they parted one from the other, and Barnabas
took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus. <sup>40</sup>And Paul, having
chosen Silas, went forth, being commended by the brethren to the
grace of God. <sup>41</sup>And he went through Syria and Cilicia,
confirming the churches.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> he came
down to Derbe and Lystra. And, behold, a certain disciple was
there, named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman, but
whose father was a Greek; <sup>2</sup>who was well reported of by
the brethren in Lystra and Iconium. <sup>3</sup>Him Paul wished to
go forth with him, and took and circumcised him on account of the
Jews who were in those places; for they all knew that his father
was a Greek.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And as they journeyed through the
cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, that were
ordained by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
<sup>5</sup>The churches, therefore, were established in the faith,
and increased in number daily.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And having gone through the region of
Phrygia and Galatia, and being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to
speak the word in Asia, <sup>7</sup>they came to Mysia, and
attempted to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit of Jesus did not
permit them. <sup>8</sup>And passing by Mysia, they came down to
Troas.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And a vision appeared to Paul in the
night. There stood a man, a Macedonian, beseeching him, and saying:
Come over into Macedonia and help us. <sup>10</sup>And when he had
seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia,
concluding that the Lord had called us to publish the good news to
them. <sup>11</sup>Therefore setting sail from Troas, we ran with a
straight course to Samothrace, and on the following day to
Neapolis; <sup>12</sup>and from thence to Philippi, which is a
chief city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we continued in
that city certain days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And on the sabbath, we went forth out
of the gate by a river side, where was wont to be a place of
prayer; and we sat down, and spoke to the women who came
together.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And a certain woman named Lydia, a
seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, was
listening; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things
spoken by Paul. <sup>15</sup>And when she was immersed and her
household, she besought us, saying: If ye have judged me to be a
believer in the Lord, come into my house, and abide. And she
constrained us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And it came to pass, as we were going
to the place of prayer, a certain bondmaid having a spirit of
divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by
soothsaying. <sup>17</sup>She, having followed Paul and us, cried,
saying: These men are the servants of the most high God, who
announce to us the way of salvation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And this she did many days. But Paul,
being indignant<sup><a href="#r441618" id="f441618" title=
"see footnote" name="f441618">18</a></sup>, turned and said to the
spirit: I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out from
her. And he came out the same hour.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And her masters, seeing that the hope
of their gain departed, laid hold of Paul and Silas, and drew them
into the market-place before the rulers. <sup>20</sup>And having
brought them to the magistrates, they said: These men, being Jews,
greatly disturb our city; <sup>21</sup>and teach customs, which it
is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And the multitude rose up together
against them; and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and
commanded to beat them with rods. <sup>23</sup>And having laid many
stripes on them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to
keep them safely; <sup>24</sup>who, having received such a charge,
thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the
stocks.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed,
and sang praises to God; and the prisoners listened to them.
<sup>26</sup>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the
doors were opened, and the chains of all were loosed.
<sup>27</sup>And the jailer, awaking out of sleep, and seeing the
prison doors open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself,
supposing that the prisoners had fled. <sup>28</sup>But Paul cried
with a loud voice, saying: Do thyself no harm; for we are all here.
<sup>29</sup>And calling for lights, he sprang in, and trembling
fell down before Paul and Silas; <sup>30</sup>and having brought
them out, he said: Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
<sup>31</sup>And they said: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
thou shalt be saved, and thy house. <sup>32</sup>And they spoke to
him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And taking them along, the same hour of
the night, he washed their stripes; and was immersed, himself and
all his, immediately. <sup>34</sup>And having brought them up into
his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced, with all his
house, believing in God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And when it was day, the magistrates
sent the sergeants, saying: Let those men go. <sup>36</sup>And the
keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul: The magistrates
have sent to let you go; now therefore depart, and go in peace.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>But Paul said to them: They beat us
openly, uncondemned, being Romans, and cast us into prison; and now
do they send us forth secretly? Nay verily; but let them come
themselves and bring us out.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>38</sup>And the sergeants reported these words
to the magistrates; and they were afraid, when they heard that they
were Romans. <sup>39</sup>And they came and besought them, and
bringing them out, entreated them to depart out of the city.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>And they went out of the prison, and
entered into the house of Lydia; and seeing the brethren they
exhorted them, and departed.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> passing
through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where
was the synagogue of the Jews. <sup>2</sup>And Paul, as his custom
was, went in to them, and for three sabbaths reasoned with them
from the Scriptures, <sup>3</sup>opening them, and setting forth
that the Christ must suffer, and rise again from the dead; and that
this is the Christ, Jesus whom I preach to you. <sup>4</sup>And
some of them believed, and joined themselves to<sup><a href=
"#r441704" id="f441704" title="see footnote" name=
"f441704">4</a></sup> Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a
great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>But the Jews, moved with
envy<sup><a href="#r441705" id="f441705" title="see footnote" name=
"f441705">5</a></sup>, having taken to them, of the idlers in the
market-place, certain vicious men, and having gathered a crowd, set
the city in an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they
sought to bring them unto the people. <sup>6</sup>And not finding
them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of
the city, crying: These that have turned the world upside down are
come hither also. <sup>7</sup>Whom Jason has received; and all
these are acting contrary to the decrees of C&aelig;sar, saying
that there is another king, Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And they troubled the people and the
rulers of the city, when they heard these things. <sup>9</sup>And
having taken security of Jason, and of the others, they let them
go.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And the brethren immediately sent away
Paul and Silas by night to Beroea; who coming thither went into the
synagogue of the Jews. <sup>11</sup>These were more noble than
those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all
readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily whether these things
were so.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Many of them therefore believed; and of
honorable Grecian women and men, not a few. <sup>13</sup>But when
the Jews of Thessalonica knew that also at Beroea the word of God
was preached by Paul, they came, stirring up the people there also.
<sup>14</sup>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to
journey as upon the sea; but Silas and Timothy abode there still.
<sup>15</sup>And they who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and
having received a command to Silas and Timothy to come to him as
soon as possible, they departed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Now while Paul was waiting for them at
Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city full of
idols. <sup>17</sup>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the
Jews and the devout persons, and in the market daily with those who
met with him. <sup>18</sup>And certain philosophers of the
Epicureans, and of the Stoics, were disputing with him. And some
said: What would this babbler say? and others: He seems to be a
proclaimer of foreign gods; because he made known to them the good
news of Jesus and the resurrection. <sup>19</sup>And taking hold of
him, they brought him upon Mars' Hill, saying: May we know what
this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest? <sup>20</sup>For thou
bringest certain strange things to our ears; we would know
therefore what these things mean. <sup>21</sup>Now all Athenians,
and the strangers residing there, spent their leisure for nothing
else, but to tell or to hear something new.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And Paul, standing in the midst of
Mars' Hill, said: Men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye
are very devout. <sup>23</sup>For as I passed by, and observed your
objects of worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: TO
AN UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore, not knowing, ye worship, him I
announce to you. <sup>24</sup>The God who made the world and all
things therein, he being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in
temples made with hands; <sup>25</sup>nor is ministered to by human
hands, as if needing anything more, himself giving to all life, and
breath, and all things. <sup>26</sup>And he made of one blood every
nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having fixed
the appointed seasons and bounds of their habitation;
<sup>27</sup>that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might
feel after him, and find him, although he is not far from every one
of us; <sup>28</sup>for in him we live, and move, and have our
being; as also some of your own poets have said: For his offspring
also are we. <sup>29</sup>Being therefore God's offspring, we ought
not to think that the Godhead is like to gold, or silver, or stone,
graven by art and man's device. <sup>30</sup>The times of ignorance
therefore God overlooked; but now, commands all men everywhere to
repent. <sup>31</sup>Because he fixed a day, in which he will judge
the world in righteousness, by the man whom he appointed, having
given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And when they heard of a resurrection
of the dead, some mocked; and others said: We will hear thee again
of this matter. <sup>33</sup>And thus Paul departed from among
them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>But certain ones, joining themselves to
him, believed; among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a
woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">fter</span> these
things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.
<sup>2</sup>And finding a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of
Pontus, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife (because
Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome), he came
to them; <sup>3</sup>and because he was of the same trade, he abode
with them, and labored; for by their occupation they were
tentmakers. <sup>4</sup>And he reasoned in the synagogue every
sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And when Silas and Timothy came down
from Macedonia, Paul was engrossed with the word, testifying to the
Jews that Jesus is the Christ. <sup>6</sup>But they opposing
themselves and blaspheming, he shook out his garments and said to
them: Your blood be upon your own head; I am clean; from henceforth
I will go to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And departing thence he entered into a
certain man's house, named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose
house was adjoining the synagogue. <sup>8</sup>And Crispus, the
ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house;
and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were
immersed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And the Lord said to Paul, through a
vision in the night: Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy
peace; <sup>10</sup>for I am with thee, and no one shall assail
thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city.
<sup>11</sup>And he continued there a year and six months, teaching
the word of God among them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And when Gallio was proconsul of
Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul, and brought
him before the judgment-seat, <sup>13</sup>saying: This man
persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And as Paul was about to open his
mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were some injustice, or
wicked misdeed, O Jews, with reason I would have borne with you.
<sup>15</sup>But if it is a question about a word, and names, and
your own law look to it yourselves; I will not be a judge of these
things <sup>16</sup>And he drove them away from the
judgment-seat.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>But having all seized upon Sosthenes,
the ruler of the synagogue, they beat him before the judgment-seat.
And Gallio cared for none of these things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And Paul having remained yet many days,
took leave of the brethren, and sailed thence to Syria, and with
him Priscilla and Aquila; having shaven his head in Cenchrea, for
he had a vow. <sup>19</sup>And they came to Ephesus, and he left
them there but entering himself into the synagogue, he reasoned
with the Jews. <sup>20</sup>And they desiring him to remain a
longer time with them, he consented not; <sup>21</sup>but took
leave of them, saying: <sup><a href="#r441821" id="f441821" title=
"see footnote" name="f441821">21</a></sup>[I must by all means keep
the coming feast at Jerusalem; but] I will return again to you, if
God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. <sup>22</sup>And having
landed at C&aelig;sarea, and gone up and saluted the church, he
went down to Antioch. <sup>23</sup>And after he had spent some time
there, he departed, going through the country of Galatia and
Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And a certain Jew named Apollos, a
native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the
Scriptures, came to Ephesus. <sup>25</sup>This man was instructed
in the way of the Lord and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and
taught correctly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the
immersion of John. <sup>26</sup>And he began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. But Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to
them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.
<sup>27</sup>And he wishing to pass through into Achaia, the
brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who, when
he was come, contributed much to those who had believed through
grace. <sup>28</sup>For he powerfully confuted the Jews in public,
showing by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> it came to
pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed
through the upper districts came to Ephesus. And finding certain
disciples, <sup>2</sup>he said to them: Did ye receive the Holy
Spirit when ye believed? And they said to him: Nay, we did not even
hear whether there is a Holy Spirit. <sup>3</sup>And he said to
them: Unto what then were ye immersed? And they said: Unto John's
immersion. <sup>4</sup>Then said Paul: John indeed immersed with
the immersion of repentance; saying to the people, that they should
believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Jesus.
<sup>5</sup>And when they heard this, they were immersed in the
name of the Lord Jesus. <sup>6</sup>And Paul having laid his hands
upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with
tongues, and prophesied. <sup>7</sup>And all the men were about
twelve.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And he went into the synagogue, and
spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them of the
things concerning the kingdom of God. <sup>9</sup>But when some
were hardened, and believed not, speaking evil of the Way before
the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples,
reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. <sup>10</sup>And this
continued for two years; so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the
word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. <sup>11</sup>And God
wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul; <sup>12</sup>so that
also there were carried from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs or
aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits
went out from them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Then some of the wandering Jewish
exorcists took upon them to name, over those who had the evil
spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I adjure you by the
Jesus whom Paul preaches. <sup>14</sup>And there were seven sons of
one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this. <sup>15</sup>And
the evil spirit answering said: Jesus I know, and Paul I well know;
but who are ye? <sup>16</sup>And the man in whom the evil spirit
was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against both,
so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
<sup>17</sup>And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks,
who dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of
the Lord Jesus was magnified. <sup>18</sup>And many of the
believers came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.
<sup>19</sup>Many of those also who practiced curious arts brought
together the books, and burned them before all; and they counted
the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
<sup>20</sup>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>When these things were ended, Paul
purposed to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia;
saying: After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
<sup>22</sup>And having sent into Macedonia two of those who
ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia
for a season.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And about that time, there arose no
small tumult concerning the Way. <sup>24</sup>For a certain man
named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana,
brought no small gain to the craftsmen; <sup>25</sup>whom he called
together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said: Sirs, ye
well know that by this craft we have our wealth.
<sup>26</sup>Moreover ye see and hear, that this Paul has persuaded
and turned aside much people, not only of Ephesus, but of almost
all Asia, saying that they are not gods, which are made with hands.
<sup>27</sup>And there is danger to us, not only that this branch
of business will come into disrepute, but also that the temple of
the great goddess Diana will be accounted nothing, and her
magnificence will be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
worship.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And hearing it, they became full of
wrath, and continued crying out, saying: Great is Diana of the
Ephesians. <sup>29</sup>And the whole city was filled with
confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having
seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions
in travel. <sup>30</sup>And Paul wishing to enter in unto the
people, the disciples suffered him not. <sup>31</sup>And some also
of the chiefs of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, entreating
him not to adventure himself into the theatre.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>Some therefore were crying one thing,
and some another; for the assembly was confused, and the greater
part knew not wherefore they had come together. <sup>33</sup>And
they brought forward Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews
thrusting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand,
desiring to make his defense to the people. <sup>34</sup>But when
they knew that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all, crying about
two hours: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And the town-clerk, having quieted the
people, said: Men of Ephesus, what human being is there, who knows
not that the city of the Ephesians is keeper of the great Diana,
and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? <sup>36</sup>These
things being therefore undeniable, ye ought to be quiet, and to do
nothing rashly. <sup>37</sup>For ye brought hither these men, who
are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.
<sup>38</sup>If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen with him,
have a matter against any man, the law is open<sup><a href=
"#r441938" id="f441938" title="see footnote" name=
"f441938">38</a></sup>, and there are proconsuls; let them implead
one another. <sup>39</sup>But if ye make any demand concerning
other matters, it shall be determined in the lawful assembly.
<sup>40</sup>For we are in danger of being called in question for
this day's riot, there being no cause whereby we may give an
account of this concourse. <sup>41</sup>And having thus spoken, he
dismissed the assembly.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> after the
tumult ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and having
embraced them, departed to go into Macedonia. <sup>2</sup>And
having gone through those regions, and given them much exhortation,
he came into Greece. <sup>3</sup>And after he had stayed three
months, a plot being laid for him by the Jews, as he was about
sailing to Syria, it was resolved that he should return through
Macedonia. <sup>4</sup>And there accompanied him unto Asia,
Sopater, son of Pyrrhus, a Beroean; and of the Thessalonians,
Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of
Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. <sup>5</sup>These, having gone
forward, were waiting for us at Troas. <sup>6</sup>But we sailed
forth from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came
to them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And on the first day of the week, we
having come together to break bread, Paul discoursed to them (being
about to depart on the morrow), and continued the discourse until
midnight. <sup>8</sup>Now there were many lights in the upper room,
where we were assembled. <sup>9</sup>And there sat on the window a
certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep;
and as Paul was long discoursing, he sunk down with sleep, and fell
down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. <sup>10</sup>And
Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said: Do not
lament, for his life is in him. <sup>11</sup>And having come up
again, and broken the bread, and eaten, he talked a long while even
till break of day, and so departed. <sup>12</sup>And they brought
the young man living, and were not a little comforted.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And we, going forward to the ship,
embarked for Assos, intending there to take in Paul; for so he had
appointed, intending himself to go on foot. <sup>14</sup>And when
he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
<sup>15</sup>And sailing thence, we came the following day over
against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos; and having
tarried at Trogyllium, we came the next day to Miletus.
<sup>16</sup>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he
might not spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were
possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus,
and called the elders of the church. <sup>18</sup>And when they
were come to him, he said to them: Ye know, from the first day that
I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you the whole
time; <sup>19</sup>serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and
with tears, and trials which befell me by the plottings of the
Jews; <sup>20</sup>how I kept back nothing that was profitable,
that I should not announce it to you, and teach you, publicly and
from house to house; <sup>21</sup>testifying, to both Jews and
Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And now, behold, I go bound in the
spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me
there; <sup>23</sup>save that the Holy Spirit witnesses to me in
every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
<sup>24</sup>But none of these things move me, neither do I count
my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with
joy<sup><a href="#r442024" id="f442024" title="see footnote" name=
"f442024">24</a></sup>, and the ministry which I received from the
Lord Jesus, to testify the good news of the grace of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And now, behold, I know that all ye,
among whom I went about preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my
face no more. <sup>26</sup>Wherefore I testify to you this day,
that I am pure from the blood of all; <sup>27</sup>for I shunned
not to declare to you the whole counsel of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Take heed therefore to yourselves, and
to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to
feed the church of the Lord<sup><a href="#r442028" id="f442028"
title="see footnote" name="f442028">28</a></sup>, which he
purchased with his own blood. <sup>29</sup>For I know this, that
after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not
sparing the flock. <sup>30</sup>And from among yourselves will men
arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
<sup>31</sup>Therefore watch, remembering that for the space of
three years, night and day, I ceased not to warn every one with
tears.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And now, brethren, I commend you to
God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you up, and
to give you an inheritance among all the sanctified. <sup>33</sup>I
coveted no one's silver, or gold, or apparel. <sup>34</sup>Ye
yourselves know, that these hands ministered to my necessities, and
to those who were with me. <sup>35</sup>In all ways I showed you
that, so laboring, ye ought to assist the weak, and to remember the
words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said: It is more blessed
to give than to receive.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And having thus spoken, he kneeled
down, and prayed with them all. <sup>37</sup>And they all wept
sorely, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him;
<sup>38</sup>sorrowing most of all for the word which he had
spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they
accompanied him to the ship.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> it came to
pass, that after we had torn ourselves from them, and had put to
sea, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the day following
to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara. <sup>2</sup>And finding a
ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and put to sea.
<sup>3</sup>And bringing Cyprus in sight, and leaving it on the
left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the
ship was to unlade her burden. <sup>4</sup>And having found out the
disciples, we remained there seven days; who said to Paul through
the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And when we had completed the days, we
departed and went our way; they all accompanying us, with wives and
children, till we were out of the city; and we kneeled down on the
beach, and prayed. <sup>6</sup>And having embraced one another, we
went on board the ship; and they returned to their homes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And we, completing the voyage, came down
from Tyre to Ptolemais; and having embraced the brethren, we
remained with them one day. <sup>8</sup>And on the morrow we
departed, and came to C&aelig;sarea; and entering into the house of
Philip the evangelist, being one of the Seven, we abode with him.
<sup>9</sup>And this man had four daughters, virgins, who
prophesied.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And while we were remaining several
days, there came down from Jud&aelig;a a certain prophet, named
Agabus. <sup>11</sup>And coming to us, he took off Paul's girdle,
and bound his own hands and feet, and said: Thus says the Holy
Spirit: So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man, whose this
girdle is, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
<sup>12</sup>And when we heard these things, both we, and they of
that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
<sup>13</sup>Then answered Paul: What mean ye, to weep and to break
my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at
Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup>14</sup>And when he
would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying: The will of the Lord be
done.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And after those days, having packed up
our baggage, we went up to Jerusalem. <sup>16</sup>There went with
us also some of the disciples from C&aelig;sarea, bringing us to
Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And when we were come to Jerusalem, the
brethren received us gladly. <sup>18</sup>And on the following day,
Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.
<sup>19</sup>And having embraced them, he recounted particularly
what things God had wrought among the Gentiles through his
ministry.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And they, hearing it, glorified the
Lord. And they said to him: Thou seest, brother, how many thousands
of Jews there are who believe; and they are all zealots for the
law. <sup>21</sup>And they were informed concerning thee, that thou
teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses,
saying that they should not circumcise their children, nor walk
after the customs. <sup>22</sup>What is it therefore? A multitude
must surely come together; for they will hear that thou hast come.
<sup>23</sup>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four
men who have a vow on them; <sup>24</sup>these take with thee, and
purify thyself with them, and bear the charges for them, that they
may shave their heads; and all will know that those things, of
which they have been informed concerning thee, are nothing, but
that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.
<sup>25</sup>But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we
wrote to them, deciding that they should observe no such thing,
except that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and
from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>Then Paul took the men, and the next
day, having purified himself with them, entered into the temple,
announcing the completion of the days of the purification, until
the offering was brought for each one of them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And as the seven days were about to be
completed, the Jews from Asia, having observed him in the temple,
stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
<sup>28</sup>crying out: Men of Israel, help. This is the man who
teaches all, everywhere, against the people, and the law, and this
place; and further also, he brought Greeks into the temple, and has
polluted this holy place. <sup>29</sup>For they had before seen
with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed
that Paul brought into the temple. <sup>30</sup>And all the city
was moved, and the people ran together; and laying hold of Paul,
they dragged him out of the temple; and forthwith the doors were
shut.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>And while they were seeking to kill
him, a report came up to the chief captain of the band, that all
Jerusalem was in an uproar; <sup>32</sup>who immediately took with
him soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and they, seeing
the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.
<sup>33</sup>Then the chief captain came near, and took hold of
him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired
who he was, and what he had done. <sup>34</sup>And some cried one
thing, some another, among the multitude; and not being able to
know the certainty on account of the tumult, he commanded him to be
led into the castle. <sup>35</sup>And when he came upon the stairs,
so it was, that he was borne by the soldiers on account of the
violence of the people. <sup>36</sup>For the multitude of the
people followed after, crying: Away with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>And as he was about to be led into the
castle, Paul says to the chief captain: May I speak to thee? And he
said: Canst thou speak Greek? <sup>38</sup>Art thou not then the
Egyptian, who before these days made an uproar, and led out into
the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins?
<sup>39</sup>And Paul said: I am a Jew of Tarsus, a citizen of no
obscure city of Cilicia; and I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to
the people.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>40</sup>And he having given him permission,
Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand to the people.
And a great silence ensuing, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue,
saying:</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class="sc">rethren</span>, and
fathers, hear my defense, which I now make to you. <sup>2</sup>And
hearing that he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the
more silence. <sup>3</sup>And he says: I am a Jew, born indeed in
Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, taught at the feet
of Gamaliel, according to the strictness of the law of the fathers,
being zealous for God, as ye all are this day. <sup>4</sup>And I
persecuted this Way unto death, binding and delivering into prisons
both men and women. <sup>5</sup>As also the high priest bears me
witness, and all the eldership; from whom, moreover, I received
letters to the brethren, and was journeying to Damascus, to bring
also those who were there bound to Jerusalem, that they might be
punished.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And it came to pass, that as I
journeyed, and came near to Damascus, about midday, there suddenly
flashed around me a great light out of heaven. <sup>7</sup>And I
fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me: Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me? <sup>8</sup>And I answered: Who art thou,
Lord? And he said to me: I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom thou
persecutest. <sup>9</sup>And they who were with me beheld indeed
the light, and were afraid; but the voice of him who spoke to me
they heard not<sup><a href="#r442209" id="f442209" title=
"see footnote" name="f442209">9</a></sup>. <sup>10</sup>And I said:
What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me: Arise, and go into
Damascus; and there it shall be told thee concerning all things
which it is appointed thee to do.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And as I could not see, for the glory
of that light, being led by the hand by those who were with me, I
came into Damascus. <sup>12</sup>And one Ananias, a devout man
according to the law, having a good report from all the Jews who
dwelt there, <sup>13</sup>came to me, and standing by me said to
me: Brother Saul, receive sight. And I, in that very hour, looked
up upon him. <sup>14</sup>And he said: The God of our fathers
appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Just One, and to
hear a voice out of his mouth. <sup>15</sup>For thou shalt be a
witness for him to all men, of what thou hast seen, and didst hear.
<sup>16</sup>And now why tarriest thou? Arise, be immersed and wash
away thy sins, calling on his name.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And it came to pass, when I had
returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, that I
was in a trance, <sup>18</sup>and saw him saying to me: Make haste,
and go forth quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive
thy testimony concerning me. <sup>19</sup>And I said: Lord, they
well know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who
believe on thee; <sup>20</sup>and when the blood of thy witness
Stephen was shed, then I myself was standing by, and consenting,
and keeping the garments of those who slew him. <sup>21</sup>And he
said to me: Depart; for I will send thee far hence to the
Gentiles.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And they heard him unto this word, and
then lifted up their voices, and said: Away with such a one from
the earth; for it was not fit that he should live. <sup>23</sup>And
as they were crying out, and throwing up their garments, and
casting dust into the air, <sup>24</sup>the chief captain commanded
him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be
examined by scourging; that he might know for what charge they were
thus crying out against him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And as they stretched him forth with
the thongs<sup><a href="#r442225" id="f442225" title="see footnote"
name="f442225">25</a></sup>, Paul said to the centurion who stood
by: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and
uncondemned? <sup>26</sup>The centurion, hearing it, he went and
told the chief captain, saying: What art thou about to do? For this
man is a Roman. <sup>27</sup>And the chief captain came, and said
to him: Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said: Yes. <sup>28</sup>And
the chief captain answered: For a great sum I obtained this
freedom. And Paul said: But I was born free.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>Immediately, therefore, they departed
from him who were about to examine him; and the chief captain also
was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had
bound him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>On the morrow, wishing to know the
certainty, wherefore he was accused by the Jews, he released him,
and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come
together; and he brought Paul down, and set him before them.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> Paul,
earnestly beholding the council, said: Men, brethren, I have lived
in all good conscience before God unto this day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And the high priest Ananias commanded
those who stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Then Paul said to him: God will smite
thee, thou whited wall. And dost thou sit to judge me according to
the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to law?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And they that stood by said: Revilest
thou God's high priest?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And Paul said: I knew not, brethren,
that he is high priest; for it is written: <span class="ot">Thou
shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And Paul, knowing that the one part were
Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council: Men,
brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of
the resurrection of the dead I am now judged.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And when he had said this, there arose a
dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the
multitude was divided. <sup>8</sup>For Sadducees say that there is
no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but Pharisees acknowledge
both.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And there arose a great clamor; and the
scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose, and contended, saying:
We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit spoke to him, or an
angel?&mdash;</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And a great dissension arising, the
chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by
them, commanded the soldiery to go down, and to take him by force
from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And the night following, the Lord stood
by him, and said: Be of good courage; for as thou didst fully
testify the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou testify
also at Rome.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And when it was day, the Jews banded
together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they
would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
<sup>13</sup>And they were more than forty who made this
conspiracy. <sup>14</sup>And they came to the chief priests and the
elders, and said: We bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste
nothing until we have slain Paul.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Now therefore do ye, with the council,
signify to the chief captain that he bring him down to you, as
though ye would ascertain more exactly the matters concerning him;
and we, before he comes near, are ready to kill him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And the son of Paul's sister, hearing
of their lying in wait, went and entered into the castle, and told
Paul. <sup>17</sup>Then Paul called one of the centurions to him,
and said: Bring this young man to the chief captain; for he has
something to tell him. <sup>18</sup>So he took him, and brought him
to the chief captain, and said: Paul, the prisoner, called me to
him, and asked me to bring this young man to thee, as he has
something to say to thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Then the chief captain took him by the
hand, and went aside privately, and asked: What is that thou hast
to tell me? <sup>20</sup>And he said: The Jews agreed to desire
thee, that thou wouldst bring down Paul to-morrow into the council,
as though they would inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.
<sup>21</sup>But do not thou yield to them; for of them more than
forty men are lying in wait for him, who bound themselves with an
oath, neither to eat nor to drink till they have killed him; and
now they are ready, looking for the promise from thee.
<sup>22</sup>The chief captain therefore dismissed the young man,
having charged him to say to no one, that thou didst show these
things to me. <sup>23</sup>And calling to him two or three of the
centurions, he said: Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to
C&aelig;sarea, and seventy horsemen, two hundred spearmen, at the
third hour of the night; <sup>24</sup>and let them provide beasts,
that they may set Paul thereon, and bring him safe to Felix the
governor.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>And he wrote a letter after this
manner: <sup>26</sup>Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor
Felix, sends greeting. <sup>27</sup>This man was taken by the Jews,
and was about to be killed by them; but I came upon them with the
soldiery, and rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman.
<sup>28</sup>And wishing to know the crime for which they were
accusing him, I brought him down into their council;
<sup>29</sup>whom I found to be accused concerning questions of
their law, but having nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or
of bonds. <sup>30</sup>And being informed that a plot was about to
be laid against the man, I sent straightway to thee, having also
commanded the accusers to say before thee what they had against
him. Farewell.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>The soldiers, therefore, as was
commanded them, took up Paul, and brought him by night to
Antipatris. <sup>32</sup>But on the morrow, leaving the horsemen to
go with him, they returned to the castle; <sup>33</sup>who, when
they had entered into C&aelig;sarea, and delivered the letter to
the governor, presented Paul also before him. <sup>34</sup>And
having read it, he asked of what province he was. And learning that
he was from Cilicia, <sup>35</sup>he said: I will hear thee fully,
when thy accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in
the pr&aelig;torium of Herod.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXIV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> after
five days, the high priest Ananias came down with the elders and a
certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against
Paul; <sup>2</sup>and he having been called, Tertullus began to
accuse him, saying: Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness,
and that very worthy deeds are done for this nation through thy
providence, in every way and everywhere; <sup>3</sup>we accept it,
most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>But, not to hinder thee too long, I pray
thee that thou wouldst hear us of thy clemency a few words.
<sup>5</sup>For we have found this man to be a pest, and exciting
disturbance among all the Jews throughout the world, and a
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes; <sup>6</sup>who also
attempted to profane the temple; whom we took, <sup><a href=
"#r442406" id="f442406" title="see footnote" name=
"f442406">6</a></sup>[and desired to judge according to our law.
<sup>7</sup>But Lysias the chief captain came, and with great
violence took him away out of our hands, <sup>8</sup>commanding his
accusers to come before thee;] from whom thou canst thyself
ascertain, by examination, concerning all these things whereof we
accuse him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And the Jews also joined in assailing
him, saying that these things were so.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Then Paul, the governor having beckoned
to him to speak, answered: Knowing that thou hast been for many
years a judge for this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for
myself; <sup>11</sup>inasmuch as thou mayest know, that there are
not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship;
<sup>12</sup>and neither in the temple did they find me disputing
with any one, or causing a tumult of the people, nor in the
synagogues, nor in the city; <sup>13</sup>nor can they prove the
things whereof they now accuse me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>But this I acknowledge to thee, that
according to the way which they call a sect, so I worship the God
of our fathers, believing all things which are written in the law
and the prophets; <sup>15</sup>having a hope toward God, which
these themselves also look for, that there will be a resurrection
both of the just and unjust. <sup>16</sup>Therefore do I also
myself strive to have always a conscience void of offense toward
God and men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And after many years I came to bring
alms to my nation, and offerings. <sup>18</sup>Amidst which they
found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor with tumult;
but certain Jews from Asia [caused it], <sup>19</sup>who ought to
be here before thee, and make accusation, if they had aught against
me. <sup>20</sup>Or let these themselves say what crime they found
in me, while I stood before the council, <sup>21</sup>except for
this one voice that I cried, standing among them: Concerning the
resurrection of the dead I am judged by you this day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And Felix put them off, knowing the
things concerning the Way more accurately, saying: When Lysias the
chief captain shall come down, I will fully inquire into your
matters. <sup>23</sup>And he commanded the centurion that he should
be guarded, and should have indulgence; and to forbid none of his
acquaintance to minister to him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And after certain days, Felix came with
his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard
him concerning the faith in Christ. <sup>25</sup>And as he reasoned
of righteousness, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix
trembled, and answered: Go thy way for this time; when I have a
convenient season, I will call for thee. <sup>26</sup>He hoped also
that money would be given him by Paul; wherefore he sent for him
the oftener, and conversed with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>But after two years, Felix was
succeeded by Porcius Festus; and Felix, wishing to gain favor with
the Jews, left Paul bound.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class="sc">estus</span>,
therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up
from C&aelig;sarea to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And the high priest and the chief of the
Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
<sup>3</sup>asking for themselves a favor against him, that he
would send for him to Jerusalem, preparing an ambush to slay him on
the way. <sup>4</sup>But Festus answered, that Paul was to be kept
a prisoner at C&aelig;sarea, and that he himself should soon go
thither. <sup>5</sup>Let them therefore, said he, who are powerful
among you, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there is any
wickedness in him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And having tarried among them not more
than eight or ten days, he went down to C&aelig;sarea; and on the
morrow, sitting on the judgment-seat, he commanded Paul to be
brought. <sup>7</sup>And when he was come, the Jews who had come
down from Jerusalem stood around, bringing many and grievous
charges, which they could not prove; <sup>8</sup>while Paul said in
defense: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the
temple, nor against C&aelig;sar, did I commit any offense.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>But Festus, wishing to gain favor with
the Jews, answered Paul, and said: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem,
and there be judged concerning these things, before me?
<sup>10</sup>And Paul said; I stand at C&aelig;sar's judgment-seat,
where I ought to be judged. To Jews I did no wrong, as thou also
very well knowest<sup><a href="#r442510" id="f442510" title=
"see footnote" name="f442510">10</a></sup>. <sup>11</sup>If then I
am an offender, and have done anything worthy of death, I refuse
not to die; but if there be none of the things whereof these accuse
me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Then Festus, having conferred with the
council, answered: Thou hast appealed to C&aelig;sar; to
C&aelig;sar thou shalt go.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And after certain days, Agrippa the
king, and Bernice, came to C&aelig;sarea to salute Festus.
<sup>14</sup>And as they were spending some days there, Festus laid
the case of Paul before the king, saying: There is a certain man
left in bonds by Felix; <sup>15</sup>about whom, when I was at
Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews made
complaint, asking for judgment against him. <sup>16</sup>To whom I
answered: It is not a custom for Romans to give up any man, before
the accused has the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to
answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>When, therefore, they had come together
here, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment-seat,
and commanded the man to be brought forth; <sup>18</sup>and
standing up around him, the accusers brought no accusation of such
things as I supposed; <sup>19</sup>but had certain controversies
with him concerning their own religion, and concerning a certain
Jesus who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
<sup>20</sup>And I, being perplexed in regard to the dispute about
these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be
judged concerning them. <sup>21</sup>But Paul having appealed, to
be kept in custody for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to
be kept until I shall send him up to C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And Agrippa said to Festus: I would
also hear the man myself. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>On the morrow, therefore, Agrippa and
Bernice having come with great pomp, and entered into the place of
hearing, with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at
Festus' command Paul was brought forth. <sup>24</sup>And Festus
said: King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye
see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews interceded
with me, both at Jerusalem and here, Crying out that he ought not
to live any longer. <sup>25</sup>But having found that he had
committed nothing worthy of death, and he himself having appealed
to Augustus, I determined to send him. <sup>26</sup>Of whom I have
nothing certain to write to my lord. Wherefore I brought him forth
before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, in order that,
the examination having been made, I may have something to write.
<sup>27</sup>For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner,
and not also signify the charges against him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXVI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> Agrippa
said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul
stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>I think myself happy, king Agrippa,
because I shall answer for myself before thee this day, concerning
all things whereof I am accused by Jews; <sup>3</sup>especially
since thou art expert in all the customs and questions among Jews.
Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>My manner of life, therefore, from my
youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation at
Jerusalem, all Jews know; <sup>5</sup>having known me from the
first, if they were willing to testify, that according to the
strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee. <sup>6</sup>And
now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God
to the fathers; <sup>7</sup>unto which our twelve tribes, earnestly
serving day and night, hope to attain; concerning which hope, O
king, I am accused by Jews.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Why is it judged incredible with you, if
God, raises the dead?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>I therefore thought to myself, that I
ought to do many hostile things against the name of Jesus the
Nazarene. <sup>10</sup>Which I also did in Jerusalem; and many of
the saints did I myself shut up in prisons, having received
authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death,
I gave my voice against them. <sup>11</sup>And punishing them
often, throughout all the synagogues, I constrained them to
blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted
them also unto foreign cities.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Whereupon, as I went to Damascus with
authority and a commission from the chief priests, <sup>13</sup>at
midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the
brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed
with me. <sup>14</sup>And we all having fallen to the earth, I
heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue:
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick
against the goads. <sup>15</sup>And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And
he said: I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. <sup>16</sup>But arise,
and stand upon thy feet; for I appeared to thee for this purpose,
to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things which
thou sawest, and of the things in which I will appear to thee;
<sup>17</sup>delivering thee from the people, and the Gentiles, to
whom I send thee, <sup>18</sup>to open their eyes, that they may
turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,
that they may obtain forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among
the sanctified, by faith in me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not
disobedient to the heavenly vision; <sup>20</sup>but to those in
Damascus first, and in Jerusalem, and unto all the region of
Jud&aelig;a, and to the Gentiles, I announced that they should
repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>For these causes the Jews, seizing me
in the temple, attempted to kill me. <sup>22</sup>Having therefore
obtained help from God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both
to small and great, saying nothing except those things which the
prophets and Moses said should come; <sup>23</sup>whether the
Christ should suffer, whether he, the first of the resurrection
from the dead, shall show light to the people and to the
Gentiles.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And as he thus spoke for himself,
Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art mad; much learning
makes thee mad.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>But he said: I am not mad, most noble
Festus; but utter words of truth and soberness. <sup>26</sup>For
the king knows well concerning these things, to whom also I speak
boldly; for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden
from him; for this has not been done in a corner. <sup>27</sup>King
Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And Agrippa said to Paul: With little
pains<sup><a href="#r442628a" id="f442628a" title="see footnote"
name="f442628a">28a</a></sup> thou persuadest<sup><a href=
"#r442628b" id="f442628b" title="see footnote" name=
"f442628b">28b</a></sup> me to become a Christian. <sup>29</sup>And
Paul said: I could pray God, that with little or much<sup><a href=
"#r442629" id="f442629" title="see footnote" name=
"f442629">29</a></sup>, not only thou, but also all that hear me
this day, may become such as I am, except these bonds.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And the king rose up, and the governor,
and Bernice, and they who sat with them. <sup>31</sup>And having
withdrawn, they talked together, saying: This man does nothing
worthy of death or of bonds. <sup>32</sup>And Agrippa said to
Festus: This man could have been set at liberty, if he had not
appealed to C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXVII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> when it
was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul
and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the
Augustan band. <sup>2</sup>And entering into a ship of Adramyttium,
about to sail along the coasts of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus,
a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. <sup>3</sup>And on the
second day we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul humanely,
and permitted him to go to his friends and receive their care.
<sup>4</sup>And thence having put to sea, we sailed under Cyprus,
because the winds were contrary, <sup>5</sup>And having sailed over
the sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of
Lycia. <sup>6</sup>And there the centurion found a ship of
Alexandria sailing to Italy; and he put us on board of it.
<sup>7</sup>And sailing slowly many days, and having come with
difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us to put
in<sup><a href="#r442707" id="f442707" title="see footnote" name=
"f442707">7</a></sup>, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
<sup>8</sup>and coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a
certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was the city
Lasa.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And much time having been spent, and the
voyage being now dangerous, because also the fast had already
passed by, Paul exhorted them, <sup>10</sup>saying: Sirs, I
perceive that the voyage will be with violence and much loss, not
only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.
<sup>11</sup>But the centurion believed the master and the owner of
the ship, more than the things spoken by Paul. <sup>12</sup>And as
the haven was not well situated for wintering, the greater number
advised to sail thence also, if by any means they might reach
Phoenix, a haven of Crete, looking toward the southwest and
northwest, and there winter.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And a south wind beginning to blow
moderately, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they
weighed anchor, and coasted along close by Crete. <sup>14</sup>But
not long after, there struck against it a tempestuous wind, called
Euracylon. <sup>15</sup>And the ship being caught, and unable to
face the wind, we yielded to it, and were driven along.
<sup>16</sup>And running under a certain small island called
Clauda, we were hardly able to come by the boat; <sup>17</sup>which
when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship;
and, fearing lest they should be cast away on the quicksand, they
lowered the sail, and so were driven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And we being violently tempest-tossed,
the next day they lightened the ship; <sup>19</sup>and the third
day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
<sup>20</sup>And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and
no small tempest lying on us, thenceforward all hope that we should
be saved was utterly taken away. <sup>21</sup>But after much
abstinence, then Paul, standing up in the midst of then, said:
Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me and not put to sea from Crete,
and so have escaped this violence and loss. <sup>22</sup>And now I
exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life
among you, but only of the ship. <sup>23</sup>For there stood by me
this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
<sup>24</sup>saying: Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before
C&aelig;sar; and, lo, God has given thee all those who sail with
thee. <sup>25</sup>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe
God, that it will be even so, as it has been told me.
<sup>26</sup>But we must be cast away upon a certain island.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>And when the fourteenth night was come,
as we were driven onward in the Adriatic sea, about midnight the
seamen suspected that they were near to some country;
<sup>28</sup>and sounding, they found twenty fathoms; and having
gone a little further, they sounded again, and found fifteen
fathoms. <sup>29</sup>Then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks,
they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And as the seamen were seeking to flee
out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under
color as if they were about to extend anchors out of the foreship,
<sup>31</sup>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: Except
these abide in the ship, ye can not be saved. <sup>32</sup>Then the
soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>And while the day was coming on, Paul
besought them all to take food, saying: This day is the fourteenth
day that ye have waited, and continued fasting, having taken
nothing. <sup>34</sup>Wherefore I pray you to take food; for this
is for your safety; for there shall not a hair fall from the head
of one of you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And having thus spoken, he took bread,
and gave thanks to God in presence of them all; and having broken
it, he began to eat. <sup>36</sup>Then were they all of good cheer,
and they also took food. <sup>37</sup>And we were in all in the
ship two hundred and seventy-six souls. <sup>38</sup>And when they
had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting out the grain
into the sea.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And when it was day, they knew not the
land; but they perceived a certain creek, having a beach, on which
they determined, if they were able, to drive the ship ashore.
<sup>40</sup>And cutting the anchors entirely away, they abandoned
them to the sea, at the same time unfastening the bands of the
rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made toward
the beach. <sup>41</sup>And falling into a place where two seas
met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow sticking fast remained
immovable, but the stern was broken by the violence of the waves.
<sup>42</sup>And it was the plan of the soldiers, that they should
kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim out, and escape.
<sup>43</sup>But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them
from their purpose; and commanded that those who could swim should
cast themselves first into the sea and get to land,
<sup>44</sup>and the rest, some on boards, and others on some of
the pieces from the ship. And so it came to pass, that all escaped
safe to land.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXVIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> having
escaped, they then learned that the island is called Melita.
<sup>2</sup>And the barbarians showed us no little kindness; for
they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present
rain, and because of the cold.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And Paul having gathered a bundle of
sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came out a viper from the
heat, and fastened on his hand. <sup>4</sup>And when the barbarians
saw the animal hanging from his hand, they said among themselves:
No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though escaped from the sea,
justice suffered not to live. <sup>5</sup>He, however, shaking off
the animal into the fire, suffered no harm. <sup>6</sup>But they
were expecting that he would become inflamed, or suddenly fall down
dead; but after looking a great while, and seeing no harm befall
him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>In the region around that place, there
were lands of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius,
who received and entertained us kindly three days. <sup>8</sup>Now
it happened, that the father of Publius was lying sick with a fever
and a bloody flux; to whom Paul entered in, and having prayed, laid
his hands on him and healed him. <sup>9</sup>And this having been
done, the others also, who had diseases in the island, came and
were healed; <sup>10</sup>who also honored us with many honors; and
when we put to sea, they loaded us with such things as were
necessary.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And after three months, we put to sea
in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose
sign was Castor and Pollux. <sup>12</sup>And landing at Syracuse,
we remained three days. <sup>13</sup>And from thence, making a
circuit<sup><a href="#r442813" id="f442813" title="see footnote"
name="f442813">13</a></sup>, we came to Rhegium. And after one day,
a south wind arose, and we came on the second day to Puteoli;
<sup>14</sup>where we found brethren, and were entreated to remain
with them seven days; and so we went toward Rome. <sup>15</sup>And
from thence, the brethren, having heard of us, came to meet us as
far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he
gave thanks to God, and took courage.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And when we came to Rome, the centurion
delivered the prisoners to the commander of the camp; but Paul was
suffered to dwell by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And it came to pass, that after three
days Paul called together those who were the chief men of the Jews;
and when they were come together, he said to them: Men, brethren,
though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our
fathers, yet I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the
hands of the Romans; <sup>18</sup>who, when they had examined me,
wished to release me, because there was no cause of death in me.
<sup>19</sup>But as the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to
appeal to C&aelig;sar; not that I have anything to charge against
my nation. <sup>20</sup>For this cause therefore I called for you,
to see and to speak with you; for on account of the hope of Israel
I am compassed with this chain.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And they said to him: We neither
received letters from Jud&aelig;a concerning thee, nor did any one
of the brethren that came, report or speak any evil concerning
thee. <sup>22</sup>But we desire to hear from thee what thou
thinkest; for concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is
spoken against.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And having appointed a day for him,
they came to him in greater numbers to his lodging; to whom he
expounded, testifying fully the kingdom of God, and persuading them
of the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the
prophets, from morning till evening. <sup>24</sup>And some believed
the things spoken, and some believed not. <sup>25</sup>And
disagreeing among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken
one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet
to our fathers, <sup>26</sup>saying:</p>
<p class="pp1">Go to this people, and say;</p>
<p class="pp1">With the hearing ye will hear, and will not
understand,</p>
<p class="pp1">And seeing ye will see, and will not perceive.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>27</sup>For the heart of this people is become
gross,</p>
<p class="pp1">And their ears are dull of hearing,</p>
<p class="pp1">And their eyes they have closed;</p>
<p class="pp1">Lest haply they see with their eyes,</p>
<p class="pp1">And hear with their ears,</p>
<p class="pp1">And understand with their heart,</p>
<p class="pp1">And turn, and I shall heal them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Be it known to you, therefore, that to
the Gentiles the salvation of God was sent; they, moreover, will
hear.<sup><a href="#r442829" id="f442829" title="see footnote"
name="f442829">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And Paul remained two whole years in
his own hired house, and gladly received all that came in to him;
<sup>31</sup>preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things
concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no one
hindering him.</p>

<h1><a name="b45" id="b45">THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE
ROMANS.</a></h1>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;P<span class=
"sc">aul</span>, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, set
apart unto the gospel of God, <sup>2</sup>which he before announced
through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures, <sup>3</sup>concerning
his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
<sup>4</sup>who was declared to be the Son of God with power
according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the
dead, Jesus Christ our Lord; <sup>5</sup>through whom we received
grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all the
nations, for his name's sake; <sup>6</sup>among whom are ye also,
called of Jesus Christ; <sup>7</sup>to all the beloved of God that
are in Rome, called to be saints: Grace to you, and peace, from God
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>First, I thank my God through Jesus
Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of in all the world.
<sup>9</sup>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the
gospel of his Son, how without ceasing I make mention of you always
in my prayers; <sup>10</sup>making request, if haply now at length
I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.
<sup>11</sup>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some
spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; <sup>12</sup>that
is, to be comforted together among you, by each other's faith, both
yours and mine.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Now I would not have you ignorant,
brethren, that often-times I purposed to come to you (but was
hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit among you also, as
among the rest of the Gentiles. <sup>14</sup>I am debtor both to
Greeks and Barbarians; both to wise and unwise. <sup>15</sup>So, as
far as lies in me, I am ready to preach the good news to you also
who are at Rome. <sup>16</sup>For I am not ashamed of the gospel;
for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. <sup>17</sup>For
therein is revealed a righteousness of God, from faith to faith; as
it is written: <span class="ot">The just shall live by
faith.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>For the wrath of God is revealed from
heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold
the truth in unrighteousness<sup><a href="#r450118" id="f450118"
title="see footnote" name="f450118">18</a></sup>;
<sup>19</sup>because that which may be known of God is manifest in
them; for God manifested it to them. <sup>20</sup>For, from the
creation of the world, his invisible things are clearly seen, being
perceived by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
Godhead; so that they are<sup><a href="#r450120" id="f450120"
title="see footnote" name="f450120">20</a></sup> without excuse.
<sup>21</sup>Because, knowing God, they glorified him not as God,
nor gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their
foolish heart was darkened. <sup>22</sup>Professing themselves to
be wise, they became fools; <sup>23</sup>and changed the glory of
the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man,
and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Wherefore God also gave them up in the
lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonor their bodies
among themselves; <sup>25</sup>who changed the truth of God into a
lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator,
who is blessed forever. Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>For this cause God gave them up to vile
passions; for their women changed the natural use into that which
is against nature; <sup>27</sup>and in like manner the men also,
leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one
toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and
receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was
meet.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And as they did not choose to retain
God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to
do those things which are not becoming; <sup>29</sup>being filled
with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness;
full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
<sup>30</sup>slanderers, haters of God, overbearing, proud,
boasters, devisers of evil things, disobedient to parents,
<sup>31</sup>without understanding, covenant-breakers, without
natural affection, implacable, unmerciful; <sup>32</sup>who,
knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are
worthy of death, not only do them, but have pleasure in those who
do them.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">herefore</span> thou
art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest; for
wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou
that judgest doest the same things. <sup>2</sup>Now we know that
the judgment of God is according to truth, upon those who commit
such things. <sup>3</sup>And reckonest thou this, O man, that
judgest those who do such things, and doest the same, that thou
shalt escape the judgment of God? <sup>4</sup>Or despisest thou the
riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not
knowing that the goodness of God is leading thee to repentance;
<sup>5</sup>and after thy hardness and impenitent heart, art
treasuring up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and of the
revelation of the righteous judgment of God; <sup>6</sup>who will
render to every man according to his deeds; <sup>7</sup>to those
who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor
and immortality, eternal life; <sup>8</sup>but to those who are
contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
indignation and wrath, <sup>9</sup>tribulation and distress, upon
every soul of man that works evil, of the Jew first, and also of
the Greek; <sup>10</sup>but glory, and honor, and peace, to every
man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>For there is no respect of persons with
God. <sup>12</sup>For as many as sinned without law shall also
perish without law; and as many as sinned with law shall be judged
by law; <sup>13</sup>(for not the hearers of law are just before
God, but the doers of law shall be justified: <sup>14</sup>for when
Gentiles, who have no law, do by nature the things required by law,
these, having no law, are a law to themselves; <sup>15</sup>who
show the work of law written in their hearts, their conscience
witnessing therewith, and their thoughts alternately accusing, or
also excusing<sup><a href="#r450215" id="f450215" title=
"see footnote" name="f450215">15</a></sup>;) <sup>16</sup>in the
day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ,
according to my gospel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>But if thou art called a Jew, and
restest upon law, and makest thy boast in God, <sup>18</sup>and
knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent,
being instructed out of the law; <sup>19</sup>and art confident
that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of those who
are in darkness, <sup>20</sup>an instructor of the foolish, a
teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of the truth in
the law; <sup>21</sup>thou then, that teachest another, dost thou
not teach thyself? Thou that preachest, a man should not steal,
dost thou steal? <sup>22</sup>Thou that sayest, a man should not
commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest
idols, dost thou commit sacrilege<sup><a href="#r450222" id=
"f450222" title="see footnote" name="f450222">22</a></sup>?
<sup>23</sup>Thou that makest thy boast in law, through the
transgression of the law dishonorest thou God? <sup>24</sup>For,
<span class="ot">the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles
because of you</span>, as it is written.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>For circumcision indeed profits, if
thou keep the law; but if thou art a transgressor of law, thy
circumcision has become uncircumcision. <sup>26</sup>If then the
uncircumcision keep the requirements of the law, shall not his
uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? <sup>27</sup>And shall
not the uncircumcision that is by nature, if it fulfill the law,
judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor
of law? <sup>28</sup>For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; nor
is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh.
<sup>29</sup>But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; and circumcision
is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise
is not of men, but of God.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">hat</span> then is
the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?
<sup>2</sup>Much every way; first, indeed, that they were intrusted
with the oracles of God. <sup>3</sup>For what if some did not
believe? Shall their unbelief make void the faithfulness of God?
<sup>4</sup>Far be it! Yea, let God be true and every man a liar;
as it is written:</p>
<p class="pp2">That thou mayest be justified in thy words,</p>
<p class="pp2">And mayest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>But if our unrighteousness commends the
righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who
takes vengeance? (I speak as a man.) <sup>6</sup>Far be it! For
then how shall God judge the world? <sup>7</sup>For if the truth of
God through my lie, abounded unto his glory, why am I also still
judged as a sinner? <sup>8</sup>And why not, as we are slanderously
reported, and as some affirm that we say: Let us do evil, that good
may come? Whose judgment is just.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>What then? Are we better? No, in no
wise; for we before charged, that both Jews and Gentiles are all
under sin. <sup>10</sup>As it is written: <span class="ot">There is
none righteous, no, no one;</span> <sup>11</sup><span class=
"ot">there is none that understands, there is none that seeks after
God.</span> <sup>12</sup><span class="ot">They are all gone out of
the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that
does good, there is not so much as one.</span>
<sup>13</sup><span class="ot">Their throat is an open sepulchre;
with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is
under their lips;</span> <sup>14</sup><span class="ot">whose mouth
is full of cursing and bitterness.</span> <sup>15</sup><span class=
"ot">Their feet are swift to shed blood.</span>
<sup>16</sup><span class="ot">Destruction and misery are in their
ways;</span> <sup>17</sup><span class="ot">and the way of peace
they have not known.</span> <sup>18</sup><span class="ot">There is
no fear of God before their eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Now we know that whatever the law says,
it says to those under the law; that every mouth may be stopped,
and all the world may become guilty before God.
<sup>20</sup>Because by works of law no flesh shall be justified in
his sight; for by law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>But now, apart from law, a
righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the
law and the prophets; <sup>22</sup>a righteousness of God through
faith in Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all that believe; (for
there is no difference; <sup>23</sup>for all sinned, and come short
of the glory of God;) <sup>24</sup>being justified freely by his
grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;
<sup>25</sup>whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith by
his blood, for the exhibition of his righteousness, because of the
passing over of the sins before committed in the forbearance of
God; <sup>26</sup>for the exhibition of his righteousness in this
present time, that he may be just, and the justifier of him who
believes in Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Where then is the boasting? It is
excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? Nay; but by the law of
faith. <sup>28</sup>Therefore we reckon that a man is justified by
faith apart from works of law. Is he the God of Jews only?
<sup>29</sup>Is he not also of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles also;
<sup>30</sup>seeing that God is one, who will justify the
circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the faith.
<sup>31</sup>Do we then make void law through the faith? Far be it!
Yea, we establish law.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">hat</span> then shall
we say that Abraham our father found, as pertaining to the flesh?
<sup>2</sup>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has ground of
boasting; but not before God. <sup>3</sup>For what says the
Scripture? <span class="ot">And Abraham believed God, and it was
reckoned to him for righteousness.</span> <sup>4</sup>Now to him
that works, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as a debt.
<sup>5</sup>But to him that works not, but believes on him who
justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.
<sup>6</sup>As also David speaks of the happiness of the man, to
whom God reckons righteousness, apart from works:</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>7</sup>Happy they, whose iniquities were
forgiven,</p>
<p class="pp1">And whose sins were covered;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>8</sup>Happy the man to whom the Lord will not
reckon sin!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Comes this happiness then on the
circumcision, or also on he uncircumcision? For we say that faith
was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. <sup>10</sup>How then
was it reckoned? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?
Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. <sup>11</sup>And he
received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of
the faith which he had while in uncircumcision; that he might be
father of all that believe while in uncircumcision, that the
righteousness might be reckoned to them also, <sup>12</sup>and
father of circumcision to those who are not only of the
circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our
father Abraham, which he had while in uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>For not through law was the promise to
Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world, but
through the righteousness of faith. <sup>14</sup>For if they that
are of law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made
of no effect. <sup>15</sup>For the law works wrath; for where there
is no law, neither is there transgression. <sup>16</sup>For this
cause it is of faith, that it may be by grace; in order that the
promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of
the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is
the father of us all, <sup>17</sup>(as it is written: <span class=
"ot">A father of many nations have I made thee,</span>) before God
whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things that
are not as though they were; <sup>18</sup>who against hope believed
in hope, that he should become father of many nations, according to
that which was spoken: So shall thy seed be. <sup>19</sup>And being
not weak in faith, he considered not his own body already dead,
being about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb.
<sup>20</sup>And in respect to the promise of God he wavered not
through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,
<sup>21</sup>and being fully persuaded, that what he has promised
he is able also to perform. <sup>22</sup>Wherefore also it was
reckoned to him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And it was not written for his sake
alone, that it was reckoned to him; <sup>24</sup>but for ours also,
to whom it shall be reckoned, if we believe on him who raised up
Jesus our Lord from the dead; <sup>25</sup>who was delivered up for
our offenses, and was raised for our justification.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class=
"sc">eing</span> justified therefore by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ; <sup>2</sup>through whom also we
obtained the access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and
rejoice in hope of the glory of God. <sup>3</sup>And not only so,
but we rejoice in afflictions also; knowing that affliction works
patience; <sup>4</sup>and patience approval; and approval hope;
<sup>5</sup>and hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God has
been poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit which was given
to us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>For when we were yet without strength,
in due season Christ died for the ungodly. <sup>7</sup>For scarcely
for a righteous man will one die; though, for the good man, perhaps
some one does even dare to die. <sup>8</sup>But God commends his
love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
us. <sup>9</sup>Much more therefore, being now justified by his
blood, shall we be saved from the wrath through him.
<sup>10</sup>For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God
through the death of his son; much more, being reconciled, shall we
be saved by his life; <sup>11</sup>and not only so, but also
rejoicing in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we
have now received the reconciliation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered
into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men,
for that all sinned; <sup>13</sup>(for until the law sin was in the
world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
<sup>14</sup>But yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over
those who sinned not after the likeness of Adam's transgression,
who is a type of him who was to come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>But not as the trespass, so also is the
free gift; for if by the trespass of the one the many died, much
more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one
man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And not as through one that sinned, is
the gift; for the judgment came of one unto condemnation, but the
free gift came of many trespasses unto justification.
<sup>17</sup>For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned
through the one; much more they who receive the abundance of the
grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life
through the one, Jesus Christ.)</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>So then, as through one trespass it
came upon all men unto condemnation; so also through one righteous
act it came upon all men unto justification of life.
<sup>19</sup>For as through the disobedience of the one man the
many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the
one will the many be constituted righteous.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Moreover the law came in also, that the
trespass might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more
abound; <sup>21</sup>that as sin reigned in death, so also might
grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life, through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">hat</span> then shall
we say? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
<sup>2</sup>Far be it! How shall we who died to sin, live any
longer therein? <sup>3</sup>Know ye not, that all we who were
immersed into Jesus Christ were immersed into his death?
<sup>4</sup>We were buried therefore with him by the immersion into
his death; that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of
the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life.
<sup>5</sup>For if we have become united with the likeness of his
death, we shall be also with that of his resurrection,
<sup>6</sup>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him,
that the body of sin might be destroyed, in order that we should no
longer be in bondage to sin. <sup>7</sup>For he that died has been
justified from sin. <sup>8</sup>And if we died with Christ, we
believe that we shall also live with him; <sup>9</sup>knowing that
Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more; death has
dominion over him no more. <sup>10</sup>For in that he died, he
died to sin once; but in that he lives, he lives to God.
<sup>11</sup>So also reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed to sin,
but alive to God through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Let not sin therefore reign in your
mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof;
<sup>13</sup>nor yield your members to sin as instruments of
unrighteousness; but yield yourselves to God as being alive from
the dead, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.
<sup>14</sup>For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are
not under law, but under grace.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>What then? Shall we sin, because we are
not under law but under grace? Far be it! <sup>16</sup>Know ye not,
that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye
are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto
righteousness? <sup>17</sup>But thanks be to God, that ye were
servants of sin, but obeyed from the heart that form of teaching
which was delivered to you<sup><a href="#r450618" id="f450618"
title="see footnote" name="f450618">18</a></sup>; <sup>18</sup>and
being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>I speak after the manner of men,
because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as ye yielded your
members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity; so
now yield your members servants to righteousness unto
sanctification. <sup>20</sup>For when ye were servants of sin, ye
were free as to righteousness. <sup>21</sup>What fruit therefore
had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end
of those things is death. <sup>22</sup>But now, being made free
from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
sanctification, and the end everlasting life. <sup>23</sup>For the
wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, in
Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;K<span class="sc">now</span> ye not,
brethren (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has
dominion over a man for so long a time as he lives? <sup>2</sup>For
the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives;
but if the husband die, she is loosed from the law of the husband.
<sup>3</sup>So then if, while the husband lives, she be married to
another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if the husband
die, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress,
though she be married to another man.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were
made dead to the law through the body of Christ, in order that ye
should be married to another, to him who was raised from the dead,
that we might bring forth fruit to God. <sup>5</sup>For when we
were in the flesh, the emotions of sins, which were by the law,
wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
<sup>6</sup>But now we are delivered from the law, having died to
that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of spirit,
and not in oldness of the letter.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>What then shall we say? Is the law sin?
Far be it! But I had not known sin, except through law; for I had
not known coveting, if the law had not said: Thou shalt not covet.
<sup>8</sup>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in
me all manner of coveting. For without law, sin is dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And I was alive without law once; but
when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
<sup>10</sup>And the commandment, which was for life, that I found
to be for death. <sup>11</sup>For sin, taking occasion by the
commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>So that the law is holy, and the
commandment holy, and just, and good.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Has then that which is good become
death to me? Far be it! But sin, that it might appear sin, working
death to me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment
might become exceedingly sinful.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>For we know that the law is spiritual;
but I am carnal, sold under sin. <sup>15</sup>For what I perform, I
know not; for not what I desire, that do I; but what I hate, that I
do. <sup>16</sup>But if what I desire not, that I do, I consent to
the law that it is good.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Now then, it is no longer I that
perform it, but the sin that dwells in me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>For I know that there dwells not in me,
that is, in my flesh, any good; for to desire is present with me;
but to perform that which is good I find not. <sup>19</sup>For the
good that I desire, I do not; but the evil that I desire not, that
I do. <sup>20</sup>But if what I desire not, that I do, it is no
more I that perform it, but the sin that dwells in me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>I find then the law, that, when I
desire to do good, evil is present with me. <sup>22</sup>For I
delight in the law of God after the inward man. <sup>23</sup>But I
see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,
and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my
members. <sup>24</sup>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me
from the body of this death? <sup>25</sup>I thank God through Jesus
Christ our Lord! So then I myself with the mind serve the law of
God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">here</span> is
therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
<sup>2</sup>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus set
me free from the law of sin and death. <sup>3</sup>For what the law
could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending
his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
sin in the flesh; <sup>4</sup>that the requirement of the law might
be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but
according to the Spirit. <sup>5</sup>For they that are according to
the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are according
to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. <sup>6</sup>For to be
carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and
peace. <sup>7</sup>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God;
for it does not submit itself to the law of God, neither indeed can
it; <sup>8</sup>and they that are in the flesh can not please
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the
Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. And if any man
has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. <sup>10</sup>And
if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin; but
the Spirit is life because of righteousness. <sup>11</sup>And if
the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you,
he who raised up Christ from the dead will also quicken your mortal
bodies, because of his Spirit that dwells in you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>So that, brethren, we are debtors, not
to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. <sup>13</sup>For if
ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die; but if by the Spirit
ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. <sup>14</sup>For
as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God.
<sup>15</sup>For ye did not receive the spirit of bondage, again to
fear; but ye received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
Father. <sup>16</sup>The Spirit itself bears witness with our
spirit, that we are children of God; <sup>17</sup>and if children,
also heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we
suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>For I reckon that the sufferings of
this present time are of no account, in comparison with the glory
which shall be revealed in us. <sup>19</sup>For the earnest longing
of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.
<sup>20</sup>For the creation was made subject to vanity, not
willingly (but by reason of him who made it subject), in hope
<sup>21</sup>that the creation itself also shall be delivered from
the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children
of God. <sup>22</sup>For we know that the whole creation groans and
travails in pain together until now. <sup>23</sup>And not only so,
but ourselves also, though we have the first-fruits of the Spirit,
even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption,
the redemption of our body.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>For we were saved in hope; but hope
that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, why does he also
hope for? <sup>25</sup>But if we hope for that we see not, we with
patience wait for it. <sup>26</sup>And in like manner does the
Spirit also help our weakness; for we know not what we should pray
for as we ought; but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us
with groanings which can not be uttered. <sup>27</sup>And he who
searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because
he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And we know that all things work
together for good to those who love God, to those who are called
according to his purpose. <sup>29</sup>Because whom he foreknew, he
also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he
might be the first-born among many brethren. <sup>30</sup>And whom
he predestined, them he also called; and whom he called, them he
also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>What then shall we say to these things?
If God is for us, who shall be against us? <sup>32</sup>He who
spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall
he not also with him freely give us all things? <sup>33</sup>Who
shall lay any thing to the charge of God's chosen? God is he that
justifies; <sup>34</sup>who is he that condemns? Christ is he that
died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is also at the right
hand of God, who also intercedes for us. <sup>35</sup>Who shall
separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword? <sup>36</sup>As it is written:</p>
<p class="pp1">For, for thy sake we are killed all the day
long;</p>
<p class="pp1">We were accounted as sheep for slaughter.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>37</sup>Nay, in all these things we are more
than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup>38</sup>For I am
persuaded, that neither death nor life, neither angels nor
principalities nor powers, neither things present nor things to
come, <sup>39</sup>neither height nor depth, nor any other created
thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is
in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I
<span class="sc">say</span> the truth in Christ, I lie not, my
conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,
<sup>2</sup>that I have great grief and continual anguish in my
heart. <sup>3</sup>For I myself could wish to be accursed from
Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh;
<sup>4</sup>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the
glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the
service, and the promises; <sup>5</sup>whose are the fathers, and
of whom as to the flesh is Christ, who is over all, God blessed
forever. Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Not as though the word of God has
failed. For not all they are Israel, who are of Israel;
<sup>7</sup>neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they
all children; but, <span class="ot">In Isaac shall thy seed be
called.</span> <sup>8</sup>That is, not they who are the children
of the flesh are children of God; but the children of the promise
are reckoned as seed. <sup>9</sup>For the word of promise is this:
<span class="ot">At this season I will come, and Sarah shall have a
son.</span> <sup>10</sup>And not only so; but when Rebecca also had
conceived by one, our father Isaac <sup>11</sup>(for they being not
yet born, nor having done anything good or evil, that the purpose
of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him
who calls), <sup>12</sup>it was said to her: <span class="ot">The
elder shall serve the younger.</span> <sup>13</sup>As it is
written:</p>
<p class="pp4">Jacob I loved,</p>
<p class="pp4">But Esau I hated.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>What then shall we say? Is there
unrighteousness with God? Far be it! <sup>15</sup>For he says to
Moses: <span class="ot">I will have mercy on whomsoever I have
mercy, and I will have compassion on whomsoever I have
compassion.</span> <sup>16</sup>So then it is not of him who wills,
nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy, <sup>17</sup>For
the Scripture says to Pharaoh: <span class="ot">Even for this very
purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show forth my power in
thee, and that my name might be declared in all the earth.</span>
<sup>18</sup>So that, on whom he will he has mercy, and whom he
will he hardens.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Thou wilt say then to me: Why then does
he yet find fault? For who resists his will? <sup>20</sup>Nay but,
O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing
formed say to him who formed it: Why didst thou make me thus?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Has not the potter power over the clay,
of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto
dishonor? <sup>22</sup>And what if God, willing to show forth his
wrath, and to make known his power, endured with much
long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction;
<sup>23</sup>and that he might make known the riches of his glory
on vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory;
<sup>24</sup>whom he also called, even us, not from among the Jews
only, but also from among the Gentiles? <sup>25</sup>As also he
says in Hosea:</p>
<p class="pp1">I will call them my people, who were not my
people;</p>
<p class="pp1">And her beloved, who was not beloved.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup><span class="ot">And it shall be, that
in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there
shall they be called, Sons of the living God.</span>
<sup>27</sup>And Isaiah cries concerning Israel:</p>
<p class="pp1">Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the
sand of the sea,</p>
<p class="pp1">The remnant shall be saved;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>28</sup>For he will finish the
work<sup><a href="#r450928a" id="f450928a" title="see footnote"
name="f450928a">28a</a></sup>,</p>
<p class="pp1">And cut it short in righteousness;</p>
<p class="pp1">Because a short work<sup><a href="#r450928b" id=
"f450928b" title="see footnote" name="f450928b">28b</a></sup> will
the Lord make upon the earth.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>29</sup>And as Isaiah has said before:</p>
<p class="pp2">Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed,</p>
<p class="pp2">We had become as Sodom,</p>
<p class="pp2">And been made like to Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>What then shall we say? That Gentiles,
who were not following after righteousness, obtained righteousness,
the righteousness which is of faith; <sup>31</sup>but Israel,
following after a law of righteousness, attained not to [such] a
law. <sup>32</sup>Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith,
but as being by works of law. For they stumbled against the stone
of stumbling; <sup>33</sup>as it is written: <span class=
"ot">Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of
offense; and he that believes on him shall not be put to
shame.</span></p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class=
"sc">rethren</span>, it is my heart's desire and prayer to God on
their behalf, that they might be saved. <sup>2</sup>For I bear them
witness, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to
knowledge. <sup>3</sup>For not knowing the righteousness of God,
and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not
submit themselves to the righteousness of God. <sup>4</sup>For
Christ is the end of the law for righteousness, to every one that
believes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>For Moses describes the righteousness
which is of the law: <span class="ot">The man that has done them,
shall live by them.</span><sup><a href="#r451005" id="f451005"
title="see footnote" name="f451005">5</a></sup> <sup>6</sup>But the
righteousness which is of faith says thus: <span class="ot">Say not
in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?</span> (that is, to
bring Christ down;) <sup>7</sup>or, <span class="ot">Who shall
descend into the abyss?</span> (that is, to bring up Christ from
the dead.) <sup>8</sup>But what says it? <span class="ot">The word
is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart;</span> that is, the
word of faith, which we preach; <sup>9</sup>because, if thou shalt
profess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart
that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
<sup>10</sup>For with the heart man believes unto righteousness;
and with the mouth profession is made unto salvation.
<sup>11</sup>For the Scripture says: <span class="ot">Whoever
believes on him shall not be put to shame.</span> <sup>12</sup>For
there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same is Lord
of all, rich toward all that call upon him;
<sup>13</sup><span class="ot">for every one who shall call upon the
name of the Lord shall be saved.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>How then shall they call on him on whom
they believed not? And how shall they believe on him of whom they
heard not? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
<sup>15</sup>And how shall they preach, unless they are sent forth?
As it is written:</p>
<p class="pp1">How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad
tidings of peace,</p>
<p class="pp1">Who bring glad tidings of good things!</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>But they did not all hearken to the
glad tidings. For Isaiah says: <span class="ot">Lord, who believed
our report?</span> <sup>17</sup>So then faith comes of hearing, and
hearing by the word of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>But I say, did they not hear? Yes
verily;</p>
<p class="pp2">Their sound went forth into all the earth,</p>
<p class="pp2">And their words unto the ends of the world.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>19</sup>But I say, did Israel not know? First
Moses says:</p>
<p class="pp1">I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are no
people,</p>
<p class="pp1">By a foolish nation I will move you to anger.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>20</sup>But Isaiah is very bold, and says:</p>
<p class="pp1">I was found by those who sought me not;</p>
<p class="pp1">I became manifest to those who asked not after
me.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>21</sup>But of Israel he says:</p>
<p class="pp1">All the day long, I stretched forth my hands,</p>
<p class="pp1">To a disobedient and gainsaying people.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">XI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I
<span class="sc">say</span> then, did God cast away his people? Far
be it! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the
tribe of Benjamin. <sup>2</sup>God did not cast away his people
whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the Scripture says in the story
of Elijah; how he pleads with God against Israel, saying:
<sup>3</sup><span class="ot">Lord they killed thy prophets, and
digged down thine altars; and I was left alone, and they seek my
life.</span> <sup>4</sup>But what says the answer of God to him?
<span class="ot">I reserved to myself seven thousand men, who bowed
not the knee to Baal.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Even so then, at this present time also,
there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
<sup>6</sup>And if by grace, it is no longer of works; otherwise,
grace becomes no longer grace. <sup><a href="#r451106" id="f451106"
title="see footnote" name="f451106">6</a></sup>[But if of works, it
is no longer grace; otherwise, work is no longer work.]</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>What then? What Israel seeks after, that
he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were
hardened. <sup>8</sup>According as it is written: <span class=
"ot">God gave them a spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not
see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this day.</span>
<sup>9</sup>And David says:</p>
<p class="pp2">Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,</p>
<p class="pp2">And a stumbling-block, and a recompense to them;</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>10</sup>Let their eyes be darkened, that they
may not see,</p>
<p class="pp2">And bow down their back alway.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>I say then, did they stumble in order
that they should fall? Far be it! But by their fall salvation is
come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. <sup>12</sup>But
if their fall is the riches of the world, and their diminution the
riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>For I am speaking to you Gentiles;
inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office;
<sup>14</sup>if by any means I may provoke to emulation those who
are my flesh, and may save some of them. <sup>15</sup>For if the
casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what shall
the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? <sup>16</sup>And
if the first-fruit is holy, so also is the lump; and if the root is
holy, so also are the branches. <sup>17</sup>And if some of the
branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive-tree, wert
grafted in among them, and became a partaker with them of the root
and the fatness of the olive-tree; <sup>18</sup>boast not over the
branches. But if thou boast, it is not thou that bearest the root,
but the root thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Thou wilt say then: The branches were
broken off, that I might be grafted in. <sup>20</sup>Well; because
of their want of faith they were broken off, and thou standest by
thy faith. Be not high-minded, but fear; <sup>21</sup>for if God
spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not
thee.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>Behold then the goodness and severity
of God; toward those who fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness,
if thou continue in his goodness; otherwise, thou also shalt be cut
off. <sup>23</sup>And they also, if they continue not in their
unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able again to graft them
in. <sup>24</sup>For if thou wast cut out of the olive-tree which
is wild by nature, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good
olive-tree; how much more shall these, who are the natural
branches, be grafted into their own olive-tree?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>For I would not, brethren, that ye
should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your
own conceits, that hardness has come upon Israel in part, until the
fullness of the Gentiles come in. <sup>26</sup>And so all Israel
shall be saved; as it is written: <span class="ot">There shall come
out of Zion the Deliverer; he will turn away ungodliness from
Jacob;</span> <sup>27</sup><span class="ot">and this is the
covenant from me to them, when I shall take away their sins.</span>
<sup>28</sup>As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your
sakes; but as concerning the election, they are beloved for the
fathers' sakes. <sup>29</sup>For unrepented are the gifts and the
calling of God. <sup>30</sup>For as ye in times past disobeyed God,
but now obtained mercy through their disobedience; <sup>31</sup>so
also they now disobeyed through the mercy shown to you, that they
also might obtain mercy. <sup>32</sup>For God included all in
disobedience<sup><a href="#r451132" id="f451132" title=
"see footnote" name="f451132">32</a></sup>, that he might have
mercy upon all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Oh, the depth of the riches, and
wisdom, and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments,
and his ways past finding out! <sup>34</sup>For,</p>
<p class="pp4">Who knew the mind of the Lord?</p>
<p class="pp4">Or who became his counselor?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>Or who first gave to him, and it shall
be given back to him again? <sup>36</sup>For of him, and through
him, and unto him, are all things; to him be the glory forever.
Amen.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I
<span class="sc">beseech</span> you, therefore, brethren, by the
mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
well pleasing to God, which is your rational service.
<sup>2</sup>And be not conformed to this world; but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind, that ye may discern what is the will
of God, the good, and well pleasing, and perfect.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>For I say, through the grace given to
me, to every one that is among you, not to think of himself more
highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as
God imparted to each one the measure of faith. <sup>4</sup>For as
we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the
same office; <sup>5</sup>so we, the many, are one body in Christ,
and severally members one of another. <sup>6</sup>And having gifts
differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether
prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of our
faith; <sup>7</sup>or ministry, [let us wait] on the ministry; or
he that teaches, on the teaching; <sup>8</sup>or he that exhorts,
on the exhortation; he that gives, [let him do it] with simplicity;
he that presides, with diligence; he that shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Let love be unfeigned. Abhor that which
is evil; cleave to that which is good. In brotherly love,
<sup>10</sup>be kindly affectioned one to another; in honor,
preferring one another; <sup>11</sup>in diligence, not slothful; in
spirit, fervent, serving the Lord; <sup>12</sup>in hope, rejoicing;
in affliction, patient; in prayer, persevering;
<sup>13</sup>communicating to the necessities of the
saints<sup><a href="#r451213" id="f451213" title="see footnote"
name="f451213">13</a></sup>; given to hospitality.
<sup>14</sup>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and curse not.
<sup>15</sup>Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who
weep. <sup>16</sup>Be of the same mind one toward another. Aspire
not to things that are high, but condescend to the lowly. Be not
wise in your own conceits. <sup>17</sup>Recompense to no one evil
for evil. Provide things honorable in the sight of all men.
<sup>18</sup>If it be possible, as far as depends on you, be at
peace with all men. <sup>19</sup>Avenge not yourselves, beloved,
but give place to the wrath [of God]. For it is written:
<span class="ot">To me belongs vengeance; I will recompense, saith
the Lord.</span> <sup>20</sup>Therefore,</p>
<p class="pp4">If thy enemy hungers, feed him;</p>
<p class="pp4">If he thirsts, give him drink.</p>
<p class="pnn">For, in doing this,</p>
<p class="pp3">Thou wilt heap coals of fire on his head.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>21</sup>Be not overcome by evil, but overcome
evil with good.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;L<span class="sc">et</span> every
soul submit himself to the higher powers. For there is no power but
from God; the powers that be have been ordained by God.
<sup>2</sup>So that he who resists the power, resists the ordinance
of God; and they that resist will receive to themselves
condemnation. <sup>3</sup>For rulers are not a terror to good
works, but to the evil. And dost thou wish not to be afraid of the
power? Do that which is good, and thou wilt have praise from it;
<sup>4</sup>for he is God's minister to thee for good. But if thou
do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in
vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger for wrath to him that
does evil. <sup>5</sup>Wherefore it is necessary to submit
yourselves, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience'
sake.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>For, for this cause ye pay tribute also;
for they are God's ministers, attending continually to this very
thing. <sup>7</sup>Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to
whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear;
honor to whom honor. <sup>8</sup>Owe no one anything, but to love
one another; for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.
<sup>9</sup>For this: <span class="ot">Thou shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not
covet;</span> and if there is any other commandment, it is briefly
comprehended in this saying, namely: <span class="ot">Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <sup>10</sup>Love works no ill
to one's neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
<sup>11</sup>And that, knowing the time, that it is high time that
we already were awaked out of sleep; for now is our salvation
nearer than when we believed. <sup>12</sup>The night is far
advanced, the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works
of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. <sup>13</sup>Let
us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness,
not in lewdness and wantonness, not in strife and envying;
<sup>14</sup>but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not
provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;H<span class="sc">im</span> that is
weak in faith receive; not for the decision of disputes.
<sup>2</sup>For one believes, that he may eat all things; but he
that is weak eats herbs. <sup>3</sup>Let not him that eats despise
him that eats not; and let not him that eats not judge him that
eats; for God received him. <sup>4</sup>Who art thou that judgest
another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he
shall be made to stand; for God is able to make him stand.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>One man esteems one day above another;
another esteems every day alike. Let each one be fully persuaded in
his own mind. <sup>6</sup>He that regards the day, regards it to
the Lord; and he that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks
to God; and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives
thanks to God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>For none of us lives to himself, and
none dies to himself. <sup>8</sup>For if we live, we live to the
Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord; whether we live therefore,
or die, we are the Lord's. <sup>9</sup>For to this end Christ died,
and lived, that he might be Lord of both the dead and living.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>But why dost thou judge thy brother? Or
why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before
the judgment-seat of God. <sup>11</sup>For it is written:
<span class="ot">As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall
bow, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span><sup><a href=
"#r451411" id="f451411" title="see footnote" name=
"f451411">11</a></sup> <sup>12</sup>So then, each one of us shall
give account of himself to God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Let us therefore no longer judge one
another; but judge this rather, not to put a stumbling-block, or an
occasion to fall, in a brother's way. <sup>14</sup>I know, and am
persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; but
to him that accounts anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
<sup>15</sup>But if because of food thy brother is grieved, thou no
longer walkest in accordance with love. Destroy not him by thy
food, for whom Christ died. <sup>16</sup>Let not then your good be
evil spoken of. <sup>17</sup>For the kingdom of God is not food and
drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
<sup>18</sup>For he that in these things serves Christ, is well
pleasing to God, and approved by men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>So then, let us follow after the things
which make for peace, and things by which one may edify another.
<sup>20</sup>For the sake of food destroy not the work of God. All
things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with
offense. <sup>21</sup>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink
wine, nor anything whereby thy brother stumbles, or is made to
offend, or is weak. <sup>22</sup>Hast thou faith? Have it to
thyself before God. Happy is he that judges not himself in that
which he allows. <sup>23</sup>And he that doubts is condemned if he
eat, because it is not of faith; and all that is not of faith is
sin.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> we that are
strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please
ourselves. <sup>2</sup>Let each one of us please his neighbor, for
his good, to edification. <sup>3</sup>For also Christ pleased not
himself; but, as it is written: <span class="ot">The reproaches of
those who reproached thee, fell on me.</span> <sup>4</sup>For
whatever things were written afore-time were for our instruction,
that we through patience and consolation of the Scriptures may have
hope. <sup>5</sup>And the God of patience and consolation grant you
to be of the same mind one with another, according to Christ Jesus;
<sup>6</sup>that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify God,
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Wherefore receive ye one another, as
Christ also received us, to the glory of God. <sup>8</sup>For I say
that Jesus Christ has been made a minister of the circumcision, for
the sake of God's truth, in order to confirm the promises made to
the fathers; <sup>9</sup>and that the Gentiles should glorify God
for his mercy; as it is written:</p>
<p class="pp1">For this cause I will give thee praise among
Gentiles.</p>
<p class="pp1">And to thy name will sing.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>10</sup>And again he says:</p>
<p class="pp1">Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>11</sup>And again:</p>
<p class="pp1">Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles;</p>
<p class="pp1">And extol him, all ye peoples.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>12</sup>And again, Isaiah says:</p>
<p class="pp1">There shall be the root of Jesse,</p>
<p class="pp1">And he who rises up to rule the Gentiles;</p>
<p class="pp1">On him will Gentiles hope.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And the God of hope fill you with all
joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, by the
power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And I myself also am persuaded of you,
my brethren, that ye also yourselves are full of goodness, filled
with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
<sup>15</sup>But I wrote the more boldly to you, brethren, in part
as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me by
God; <sup>16</sup>that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to
the Gentiles, ministering as a priest in the gospel of God, that
the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, being sanctified
by the Holy Spirit. <sup>17</sup>I have therefore my glorying in
Christ Jesus, as to things pertaining to God. <sup>18</sup>For I
will not dare to speak of any of the things which Christ wrought
not through me, to bring the Gentiles to obedience, by word and
deed, <sup>19</sup>in the power of signs and wonders, in the power
of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to
Illyricum, I have fully preached the good news of Christ;
<sup>20</sup>being emulous so to preach the good news, not where
Christ was named, lest I should build upon another's foundation;
<sup>21</sup>but as it is written:</p>
<p class="pp1">They to whom it was not announced concerning him
shall see,</p>
<p class="pp1">And they that have not heard shall understand.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>For which cause also, for the most
part, I was hindered from coming to you. <sup>23</sup>But now
having no longer place in these regions, and having a great desire
these many years to come to you, <sup>24</sup>whenever I go into
Spain, I hope to see you in my journey, and to be sent forward
thither by you, if first I shall be satisfied in a measure with
your company.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>But now I am going to Jerusalem to
minister to the saints. <sup>26</sup>For Macedonia and Achaia
thought it good, to make a certain contribution for the poor among
the saints who were at Jerusalem. <sup>27</sup>For they thought it
good; and their debtors are they. For if the Gentiles shared in
their spiritual things, they ought also to minister to them in
carnal things. <sup>28</sup>When therefore I have performed this,
and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.
<sup>29</sup>And I know that, when I come to you, I shall come in
the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>And I beseech you, brethren, by our
Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, to strive
together with me in your prayers to God for me; <sup>31</sup>that I
may be delivered from the unbelieving in Jud&aelig;a, and that my
service which is for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;
<sup>32</sup>that with joy I may come to you by the will of God,
and may with you be refreshed. <sup>33</sup>And the God of peace be

<h1><a name="b46" id="b46">THE FIRST LETTER OF PAUL TO THE
CORINTHIANS.</a></h1>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;P<span class=
"sc">aul</span>, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will
of God, and Sosthenes the brother, <sup>2</sup>to the church of God
which is at Corinth, those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus
Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: <sup>3</sup>Grace to you,
and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>I thank my God always on your behalf,
for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;
<sup>5</sup>that in everything ye were made rich in him, in all
utterance and all knowledge; <sup>6</sup>according as the testimony
of Christ was confirmed in you; <sup>7</sup>so that ye are behind
in no gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
<sup>8</sup>who will also confirm you unto the end, unaccused in
the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup>9</sup>God is faithful, by
whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ
our Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>But I beseech you, brethren, by the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing,
and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be made
complete in the same mind, and in the same judgment.
<sup>11</sup>For it was made known to me concerning you, my
brethren; by those of the house of Chloe, that there are
contentions among you. <sup>12</sup>And I mean this, that each of
you says, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of
Christ. <sup>13</sup>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you?
Or were ye immersed in the name of Paul? <sup>14</sup>I thank God
that I immersed none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
<sup>15</sup>that no one may say that I immersed in my own name.
<sup>16</sup>And I immersed also the household of Stephanas;
besides, I know not whether I immersed any other.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>For Christ did not send me to immerse,
but to preach the glad tidings; not with wisdom of speech, lest the
cross of Christ should be made of no effect. <sup>18</sup>For the
preaching of the cross is to those who perish, foolishness; but to
us who are saved, it is the power of God. <sup>19</sup>For it is
written:</p>
<p class="pp1">I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,</p>
<p class="pp1">And will bring to nothing the prudence of the
prudent.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe?
Where is the disputer of this world? Did not God make foolish the
wisdom of the world? <sup>21</sup>For since, in the wisdom of God,
the world through its wisdom knew not God, God was pleased through
the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe;
<sup>22</sup>since Jews require signs, and Greeks seek after
wisdom, <sup>23</sup>but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a
stumbling-block, and to Gentiles foolishness, <sup>24</sup>but to
those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of
God, and the wisdom of God. <sup>25</sup>Because the foolishness of
God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than
men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>For see your calling, brethren, that
not many are wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;
<sup>27</sup>but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he
might put to shame the wise; and God chose the weak things of the
world, that he might put to shame the things which are strong;
<sup>28</sup>and the base things of the world, and the things which
are despised, did God choose, and the things which are not, that he
might bring to naught things that are; <sup>29</sup>that no flesh
should glory before God. <sup>30</sup>But of him are ye in Christ
Jesus, who from God was made wisdom to us, both righteousness and
sanctification, and redemption; <sup>31</sup>that, according as it
is written: <span class="ot">He that glories, let him glory in the
Lord.</span></p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I
<span class="sc">also</span>, when I came to you, brethren, came
not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the
testimony of God. <sup>2</sup>For I determined not to know anything
among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. <sup>3</sup>And I
was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
<sup>4</sup>And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive
words of man's wisdom, but with demonstration of the Spirit and of
power; <sup>5</sup>that your faith might not stand in the wisdom of
men, but in the power of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>But we speak wisdom among those who are
perfect; but a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this
world, who come to naught. <sup>7</sup>But we speak God's wisdom in
a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the
worlds unto our glory; <sup>8</sup>which no one of the rulers of
this world has known; for had they known it, they would not have
crucified the Lord of glory; <sup>9</sup>but (as it is written)
<span class="ot">things which eye saw not, nor ear heard, and which
entered not into the heart of man, which God prepared for those who
love him;</span> <sup>10</sup>but to us God revealed them by his
Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of
God. <sup>11</sup>For who among men knows the things of a man, save
the spirit of the man, which is in him? So also the things of God
no one knows, but the Spirit of God. <sup>12</sup>And we received,
not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that
we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.
<sup>13</sup>Which things also we speak, not in words taught by
man's wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit; comparing
spiritual things with spiritual<sup><a href="#r460213" id="f460213"
title="see footnote" name="f460213">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>But the natural man receives not the
things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and
he can not know them, because they are spiritually judged.
<sup>15</sup>But he that is spiritual judges all things; but he
himself is judged by no one. <sup>16</sup><span class="ot">For who
knew the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?</span> But we
have the mind of Christ.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I
<span class="sc">also</span>, brethren, was not able to speak to
you as spiritual, but as carnal, as babes in Christ. <sup>2</sup>I
fed you with milk, and not with meat; for ye were not yet able to
bear it; nay, nor even now are ye able. <sup>3</sup>For ye are yet
carnal; for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and
divisions, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk as men?
<sup>4</sup>For when one says, I am of Paul; and another, I am of
Apollos; are ye not carnal? <sup>5</sup>Who then is Paul, and who
is Apollos, but ministers through whom ye believed, even as the
Lord gave to each one? <sup>6</sup>I planted, Apollos watered; but
God gave the increase. <sup>7</sup>So then neither is he that
plants anything, nor he that waters; but God that gives the
increase. <sup>8</sup>And he that plants and he that waters are
one; and each will receive his own reward according to his own
labor.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>For we are God's fellow-laborers; ye are
God's field, God's building. <sup>10</sup>According to the grace of
God which was given to me, as a wise master-builder I laid a
foundation, and another builds thereon. But let each one take heed
how he builds thereon. <sup>11</sup>For other foundation can no one
lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
<sup>12</sup>And if any one builds on this foundation gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; <sup>13</sup>the work of each
one will be made manifest; for the day will show it, because it is
revealed in fire, and the fire itself will prove of what sort is
each one's work. <sup>14</sup>If any one's work which he built
thereon remains, he will receive reward. <sup>15</sup>If any one's
work shall be burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will
be saved; yet so as through fire.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Know ye not that ye are God's temple,
and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? <sup>17</sup>If any one
defiles<sup><a href="#r460317" id="f460317" title="see footnote"
name="f460317">17</a></sup> the temple of God, him will God
destroy; for the temple of God is holy, the which are ye.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Let no one deceive himself. If any one
seems to be wise among you in this world, let him become a fool,
that he may become wise. <sup>19</sup>For the wisdom of this world
is foolishness with God. For it is written: <span class="ot">He
that takes the wise in their craftiness.</span> <sup>20</sup>And
again:</p>
<p class="pp2">The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise,</p>
<p class="pp2">That they are vain.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>So then, let no one glory in men. For
all things are yours; <sup>22</sup>whether Paul, or Apollos, or
Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or
things to come, all are yours; <sup>23</sup>and ye are Christ's,
and Christ is God's.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;S<span class="sc">o</span> let a man
account us, as ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries
of God. <sup>2</sup>Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a
man be found faithful. <sup>3</sup>But with me it is a very small
thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's day<sup><a href=
"#r460403" id="f460403" title="see footnote" name=
"f460403">3</a></sup>; nay, neither do I judge myself.
<sup>4</sup>For I am conscious to myself of nothing; yet am I not
hereby justified, but he that judges me is the Lord. <sup>5</sup>So
then judge not anything before the time, until the Lord come, who
will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make
manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each one have
his praise of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And these things, brethren, I have in a
figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us
ye may learn not to go beyond that which is written, that ye be not
puffed up each for one against another. <sup>7</sup>For who makes
thee to differ? And what hast thou, that thou didst not receive?
But if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst
not received it? <sup>8</sup>Already ye are filled full, already ye
became rich, without us ye reigned as kings; and I would ye did
reign, that we also might reign with you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>For I think that God set forth us the
apostles last, as condemned to death; for we have become a
spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men. <sup>10</sup>We
are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are
weak, but ye are strong; ye are honorable, but we are despised.
<sup>11</sup>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and
thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain
dwelling-place; <sup>12</sup>and labor, working with our own hands;
being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
<sup>13</sup>being defamed, we entreat; we have become as the filth
of the world, the offscouring of all things unto this day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>I write not these things to shame you,
but as my beloved sons I admonish you. <sup>15</sup>For though ye
have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many
fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begot you through the gospel.
<sup>16</sup>I beseech you therefore, be followers of
me<sup><a href="#r460416" id="f460416" title="see footnote" name=
"f460416">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>For this cause I sent to you Timothy,
who is my child, beloved and faithful in the Lord, who will bring
to your remembrance my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in
every church.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Now some were puffed up, as though I
were not coming to you. <sup>19</sup>But I will come to you
shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the word of those who
are puffed up, but the power. <sup>20</sup>For the kingdom of God
is not in word, but in power. <sup>21</sup>What will ye? Shall I
come to you with a rod, or in love, and the spirit of meekness?</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I<span class=
"sc">t</span> is commonly reported that there is fornication among
you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that
one should have his father's wife. <sup>2</sup>And ye are puffed
up, and did not rather mourn, that he who did this deed might be
taken away from among you. <sup>3</sup>For I verily, as absent in
body but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were
present, concerning him who has so done this; <sup>4</sup>in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye being gathered together, and my
spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, <sup>5</sup>to
deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that
the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Your glorying is not good. Know ye not
that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? <sup>7</sup>Cleanse
out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according
as ye are unleavened. For our passover, Christ, was sacrificed for
us; <sup>8</sup>therefore let us keep the feast, not with old
leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>I wrote to you, in my letter, not to
keep company with fornicators; <sup>10</sup>yet not, altogether,
with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or
extortioners, or idolaters; for then ye must needs go out of the
world. <sup>11</sup>But as it is, I wrote to you not to keep
company, if any one called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous,
or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with
such a one not even to eat.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>For what have I to do with judging
those also who are without? Do not ye judge those who are within?
<sup>13</sup>But those who are without God judges. Therefore put
away that wicked man from among yourselves.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;D<span class="sc">are</span> any one of
you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust,
and not before the saints? <sup>2</sup>Do ye not know that the
saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by
you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
<sup>3</sup>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? How much more
the things of this life? <sup>4</sup>If then ye have judgments
about things of this life, set those to judge who are of no esteem
in the church.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that
there is not a wise man among you, not even one that shall be able
to judge between his brethren; <sup>6</sup>but brother goes to law
with brother, and that before unbelievers? <sup>7</sup>Now
therefore, it is altogether a fault among you, because ye go to law
one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not
rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? <sup>8</sup>Nay, ye do
wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. <sup>9</sup>Know ye not
that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not
deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
the effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
<sup>10</sup>nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor
revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
<sup>11</sup>And such were some of you; but ye were washed, but ye
were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord
Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>All things are lawful for me, but not
all things are expedient; all things are lawful for me, but I will
not be brought under the power of anything. <sup>13</sup>Meats for
the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will destroy both it
and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord;
and the Lord for the body. <sup>14</sup>And God both raised the
Lord, and will also raise up us by his power.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Know ye not that your bodies are
members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and
make them members of a harlot? Far be it! <sup>16</sup>Know ye not
that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? <span class="ot">For
the two,</span> says he, <span class="ot">shall be one
flesh.</span> <sup>17</sup>But he that is joined to the Lord is one
spirit. <sup>18</sup>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man commits
is without the body; but he that commits fornication, sins against
his own body. <sup>19</sup>Know ye not that your body is the temple
of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom ye have from God, and ye
are not your own? <sup>20</sup>For ye are bought with a price;
therefore glorify God in your body.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> concerning
the things whereof ye wrote to me: It is good for a man not to
touch a woman; <sup>2</sup>but because of fornication, let each man
have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
<sup>3</sup>Let the husband render to the wife her due; and in like
manner the wife also to the husband. <sup>4</sup>The wife has not
power over her own body, but the husband; and in like manner the
husband also has not power over his own body, but the wife.
<sup>5</sup>Defraud not one the other, except it be with consent
for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and
come again together, that Satan may not tempt you on account of
your incontinency.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>But this I say by way of permission, not
of command. <sup>7</sup>But I would that all men were as myself.
But each one has his own gift from God, one after this manner, and
another after that.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And I say to the unmarried and the
widows, it is good for them if they remain as I also am.
<sup>9</sup>But if they have not self-control, let them marry; for
it is better to marry than to burn.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And the married not I command, but the
Lord, that the wife depart not from the husband. <sup>11</sup>But
if she have departed, let her remain unmarried, or let her be
reconciled to her husband; and let the husband not put away his
wife.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If
any brother has a wife that believes not, and she is pleased to
dwell with him, let him not put her away. <sup>13</sup>And a woman
who has a husband that believes not, and he is pleased to dwell
with her, let her not leave her husband. <sup>14</sup>For the
unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving
wife is sanctified in the husband; else your children are unclean;
but now they are holy.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>But if the unbelieving departs, let him
depart. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such
cases; but God has called us to peace. <sup>16</sup>For what
knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or what
knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
<sup>17</sup>Only, as the Lord apportioned to each one, as God has
called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the
churches.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Was any one called being circumcised?
Let him not become uncircumcised. Has any one been called in
uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
<sup>19</sup>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is
nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Let each one abide in the same calling
wherein he was called. <sup>21</sup>Wast thou called being a
servant? Care not for it; but if thou canst become free, use it
rather. <sup>22</sup>For he that was called in the Lord, being a
servant, is the Lord's freedman; in like manner also the freeman,
being called, is Christ's servant. <sup>23</sup>Ye were bought with
a price; become not servants of men. <sup>24</sup>Brethren, let
every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Now concerning virgins I have no
commandment of the Lord; but I give my judgment, as one that has
obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. <sup>26</sup>I consider
therefore that this is good on account of the present necessity,
that it is good for a man so to be. <sup>27</sup>Art thou bound to
a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek
not a wife. <sup>28</sup>But if also thou marry, thou sinnedst not;
and if a virgin marry, she sinned not. But such shall have
affliction in the flesh; but I spare you<sup><a href="#r460728" id=
"f460728" title="see footnote" name="f460728">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>But this I say, brethren, the time that
remains is short; that both they who have wives may be as though
they had none; <sup>30</sup>and they that weep, as though they wept
not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they
that buy, as though they possessed not; <sup>31</sup>and they that
use this world, as not abusing it; for the fashion of this world is
passing away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>But I would have you without cares. He
that is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall
please the Lord; <sup>33</sup>but he that is married cares for the
things of the world, how he shall please his wife.
<sup>34</sup>There is a difference also between the wife and the
virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that
she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she that is married
cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her
husband.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>And this I say for your own profit; not
that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and
that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
<sup>36</sup>But if any one thinks that he behaves himself unseemly
toward his virgin, if she be past the flower of her age, and need
so require, let him do what he will, he sins not; let them marry.
<sup>37</sup>But he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no
necessity, but has power over his own will, and has determined this
in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.
<sup>38</sup>So that both he that gives her in marriage does well,
and he that gives her not in marriage does better.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>A wife is bound as long as her husband
lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married
to whom she will; only in the Lord. <sup>40</sup>But she is happier
if she so abide, after my judgment; and I too think that I have the
Spirit of God.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span>
concerning the things offered to idols, we know that we all have
knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. <sup>2</sup>If any
one thinks that he knows anything, he has known nothing yet as he
ought to know. <sup>3</sup>But if any one loves God, the same is
known by him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>As concerning then the eating of the
things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the
world, and that there is no other God but one. <sup>5</sup>For
though there are gods so-called, whether in heaven or on earth (as
there are gods many, and lords many), <sup>6</sup>yet to us there
is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto
him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>But there is not in all men this
knowledge; for some, with a consciousness till now of the idol, eat
it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak
is defiled. <sup>8</sup>But food commends us not to God; for
neither, if we eat, are we the better; nor, if we eat not, are we
the worse. <sup>9</sup>But take heed, lest haply this liberty of
yours become a stumbling-block to the weak. <sup>10</sup>For if any
one sees thee, who hast knowledge, reclining at table in an idol's
temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to
eat the things offered to idols? <sup>11</sup>And through thy
knowledge he that is weak perishes, the brother for whom Christ
died! <sup>12</sup>But when ye so sin against the brethren, and
wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
<sup>13</sup>Wherefore, if food cause my brother to offend, I will
eat no flesh for ever more, that I may not cause my brother to
offend.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">m</span> I not an
apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are
not ye my work in the Lord? <sup>2</sup>If I am not an apostle to
others, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of my apostleship
are ye in the Lord. <sup>3</sup>This is my answer to those who
examine me. <sup>4</sup>Have we not power to eat and to drink?
<sup>5</sup>Have we not power to lead about a sister as a wife, as
well as the other apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and
Cephas? <sup>6</sup>Or have only I and Barnabas not power to
forbear working? <sup>7</sup>Who ever goes to war at his own
charges? Who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof?
Or who tends a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Say I these things as a man? Or does not
the law also say these things? <sup>9</sup>For it is written in the
law of Moses: <span class="ot">Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while
treading out the grain.</span> Is it for the oxen that God cares?
<sup>10</sup>Or does he say it altogether for our sakes? For, for
our sakes it was written; that he who plows ought to plow in hope;
and he who threshes, in hope of partaking. <sup>11</sup>If we sowed
for you, the things that are spiritual, is it a great thing if we
shall reap your carnal things? <sup>12</sup>If others partake of
this power over you, do not we still more? But we used not this
power; but we bear all things, that we may not cause any hindrance
to the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Do ye not know that they who minister
about the holy things eat of the temple, and they who wait at the
altar partake with the altar? <sup>14</sup>So also did the Lord
appoint to those who preach the gospel, to live by the gospel.
<sup>15</sup>But I have used none of these things; and I wrote not
these things, that it should be so done to me; for it were better
for me to die, than that any one should make my glorying void.
<sup>16</sup>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory
of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for, woe is to me, if I preach
not the gospel! <sup>17</sup>For if I do this willingly, I have a
reward; but if unwillingly, I have a stewardship intrusted to
me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>What then is my reward? That, in
preaching the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, that I
use not to the full my power in the gospel. <sup>19</sup>For being
free from all men, I made myself servant to all, that I might gain
the more. <sup>20</sup>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I
might gain Jews; to those under law, as under law, not being myself
under law, that I might gain those under law; <sup>21</sup>to those
without law, as without law (not being without law to God, but
under law to Christ), that I might gain those without law.
<sup>22</sup>To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the
weak. I have become all things to all, that I may by all means save
some. <sup>23</sup>And all things I do for the gospel's sake, that
I may become a partaker thereof with others<sup><a href="#r460923"
id="f460923" title="see footnote" name="f460923">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Know ye not that they who run in a
race, all indeed run, but one receives the prize? So run, that ye
may obtain. <sup>25</sup>And every one who contends for the prize
is temperate in all things; they indeed to obtain a corruptible
crown, but we an incorruptible. <sup>26</sup>I therefore so run, as
not uncertainly; I so fight, as not beating the air.
<sup>27</sup>But I keep under my body, and bring it into
subjection; lest haply, having preached to others, I myself should
be rejected.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class=
"sc">or</span> I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our
fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
<sup>2</sup>and were all immersed unto Moses in the cloud and in
the sea; <sup>3</sup>and all ate the same spiritual food,
<sup>4</sup>and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank
of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.
<sup>5</sup>But in the most of them God had no pleasure; for they
were overthrown in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Now these things were examples to us, in
order that we should not lust after evil things, as they also
lusted. <sup>7</sup>Nor be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as
it is written: <span class="ot">The people sat down to eat and
drink, and rose up to play.</span> <sup>8</sup>Nor let us commit
fornication, as some of them did, and fell in one day three and
twenty thousand. <sup>9</sup>Nor let us tempt Christ, as some of
them tempted, and perished by the serpents. <sup>10</sup>Nor murmur
ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Now all these things happened to them
as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom
the ends of the ages are come. <sup>12</sup>Wherefore let him that
thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. <sup>13</sup>There has no
temptation taken you but such as belongs to man; and God is
faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted beyond what ye are
able, but will with the temptation make also the way of escape,
that ye may be able to bear it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Wherefore, my beloved, flee from
idolatry. <sup>15</sup>I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
<sup>16</sup>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a
partaking of the blood of Christ? The loaf which we break, is it
not a partaking of the body of Christ? <sup>17</sup>Because we, the
many, are one loaf, one body; for we all share in that one
loaf.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Behold Israel according to the flesh.
Are not they who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>What then do I say? That an idol is
anything, or that what is offered to idols is anything?
<sup>20</sup>Nay; but that what they sacrifice, they sacrifice to
demons, and not to God; and I would not that ye should be partakers
of the demons. <sup>21</sup>Ye can not drink the cup of the Lord,
and the cup of demons; ye can not share in the table of the Lord,
and the table of demons.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are
we stronger than he? <sup>23</sup>All things are lawful, but not
all things are expedient; all things are lawful, but not all things
edify. <sup>24</sup>Let no one seek his own, but his neighbor's
good.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Whatever is sold in the market eat,
asking no question for conscience sake'; <sup>26</sup>for the earth
is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>If any of the unbelieving bids you to a
feast, and ye choose to go, whatever is set before you eat, asking
no question for conscience' sake. <sup>28</sup>But if any one say
to you: This is a thing sacrificed to a god, eat it not, for his
sake that showed it, and for conscience' sake.
<sup>29</sup>Conscience, I say, not thine own, but that of the
other; for why is my liberty judged by another's conscience?
<sup>30</sup>If I partake with thanks, why am I evil spoken of, for
that for which I give thanks?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or
whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God. <sup>32</sup>Give no
occasion of stumbling, either to Jews or Greeks, or to the church
of God; <sup>33</sup>as I also please all in all things, not
seeking my own profit, but that of the many, that they may be
saved. <sup>1</sup>B<span class="sc">e</span> ye followers of me,
as I also am of Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye
remember me in all things, and, hold fast the
traditions<sup><a href="#r461102" id="f461102" title="see footnote"
name="f461102">2</a></sup>, as I delivered them to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And I would have you know, that the head
of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and
the head of Christ is God. <sup>4</sup>Every man praying or
prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
<sup>5</sup>But every woman praying or prophesying with the head
uncovered, dishonors her head; for it is one and the same as if she
were shaven. <sup>6</sup>For if a woman is not covered, let her
also be shorn; but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or
shaven, let her be covered. <sup>7</sup>For a man indeed ought not
to cover his head, being the image and glory of God; but the woman
is the glory of the man. <sup>8</sup>For the man is not of the
woman; but the woman of the man. <sup>9</sup>And the man was not
created for the woman, but the woman for the man. <sup>10</sup>For
this cause ought the woman to have [the token of] authority on her
head, because of the angels.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Nevertheless, neither is the woman
without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.
<sup>12</sup>For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by
the woman; but all things of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Judge in your own selves; is it seemly
that a woman pray to God uncovered? <sup>14</sup>Does not even
nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a
shame to him? <sup>15</sup>But if a woman have long hair, it is a
glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>But if any man seems to be contentious,
we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And while I enjoin this, I praise you
not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
<sup>18</sup>For first of all, when ye come together in the church,
I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
<sup>19</sup>For there must be also sects among you, that they who
are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>When therefore ye come together into
one place, there is no eating of a supper of the Lord<sup><a href=
"#r461120" id="f461120" title="see footnote" name=
"f461120">20</a></sup>. <sup>21</sup>For in eating, each takes
without waiting his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is
drunken. <sup>22</sup>What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink
in? Or despise ye the church of God, and shame those who have not?
What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you
not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>For I received from the Lord, what I
also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which
he was betrayed, took a loaf; <sup>24</sup>and having given thanks,
he broke it, and said: This is my body, which is for you; this do
in remembrance of me. <sup>25</sup>In like manner also the cup,
after they had supped, saying: This cup is the new covenant in my
blood; this do, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
<sup>26</sup>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup,
ye show the Lord's death till he come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>So that whoever eats the bread or
drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body
and the blood of the Lord. <sup>28</sup>But let a man examine
himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
<sup>29</sup>For he that eats and drinks, eats and drinks
condemnation to himself, if he discern not the body.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>For this cause many are weak and sickly
among you, and many sleep. <sup>31</sup>For if we judged ourselves;
we should not be judged. <sup>32</sup>But being judged, we are
chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the
world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Wherefore, my brethren, when coming
together to eat, wait for one another. <sup>34</sup>If any one is
hungry, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto
condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> concerning
the spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried
away to the dumb idols, as ye were led. <sup>3</sup>Wherefore I
give you to understand, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God
calls Jesus accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord, but by the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Now there are diversities of gifts, but
the same Spirit. <sup>5</sup>And there are diversities of
ministrations, and the same Lord. <sup>6</sup>And there are
diversities of operations, but the same God who works all in all.
<sup>7</sup>But to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit,
for profiting. <sup>8</sup>For to one is given through the Spirit
the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge according to
the same Spirit; <sup>9</sup>to another faith, by the same Spirit;
to another gifts of healings by the one Spirit; <sup>10</sup>to
another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
discerning of spirits; to another diversities of tongues; to
another the interpretation of tongues. <sup>11</sup>But all these
works the one and self-same Spirit, dividing to each one severally
as he will.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>For as the body is one and has many
members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body,
so also is Christ. <sup>13</sup>For by one Spirit we were all
immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or
free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>For the body is not one member, but
many. <sup>15</sup>If the foot say: Because I am not a hand, I am
not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
<sup>16</sup>And if the ear say: Because I am not an eye, I am not
of the body; it is not therefore not of the body. <sup>17</sup>If
the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole
were hearing, where were the smelling?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>But now, God set the members each one
of them in the body, as it pleased him. <sup>19</sup>And if they
were all one member, where were the body? <sup>20</sup>But now
there are many members, but one body. <sup>21</sup>And the eye can
not say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to
the feet, I have no need of you. <sup>22</sup>Nay, much more those
members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary;
<sup>23</sup>and those which we think to be less honorable parts of
the body, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely
parts have more abundant comeliness. <sup>24</sup>And our comely
parts have no need; but God attempered the body together, giving
more abundant honor to that which lacked; <sup>25</sup>that there
may be no division in the body, but that the members should have
the same care one for another. <sup>26</sup>And whether one member
suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored,
all the members rejoice with it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Now ye are the body of Christ, and
members each one<sup><a href="#r461227" id="f461227" title=
"see footnote" name="f461227">27</a></sup>. <sup>28</sup>And God
set some in the church, apostles first, secondly prophets, thirdly
teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
governings, diversities of tongues. <sup>29</sup>Are all apostles?
Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
<sup>30</sup>Have all gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues?
Do all interpret? <sup>31</sup>But desire earnestly the greater
gifts; and moreover, I show to you a more excellent way.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>1</sup>Though I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or
a tinkling cymbal. <sup>2</sup>And though I have the gift of
prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and
though I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not
love, I am nothing. <sup>3</sup>And though I bestow all my goods in
food, and though I give up my body that I may be burned, and have
not love, it profits me nothing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Love suffers long, is kind; love envies
not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up, <sup>5</sup>does not
behave itself unseemly, seeks not its own, is not easily provoked,
imputes no evil; <sup>6</sup>rejoices not at unrighteousness, but
rejoices with the truth; <sup>7</sup>bears all things, believes all
things, hopes all things, endures all things. <sup>8</sup>Love
never fails; but whether there are prophesyings, they will be done
away; whether tongues, they will cease; whether knowledge, it will
be done away. <sup>9</sup>For we know in part, and we prophesy in
part. <sup>10</sup>But when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part will be done away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>When I was a child, I spoke as a child,
I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; but now that I am
become a man, I have done away the things of the child.
<sup>12</sup>For we see now in a mirror, obscurely; but then face
to face. Now I know in part; but then I shall know fully, even as I
also am fully known.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And now remain faith, hope, love, these
three; and the greatest of these is love.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>1</sup>Pursue after love; and desire earnestly
the spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
<sup>2</sup>For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to
men, but to God; for no one understands; but with the spirit he
speaks mysteries. <sup>3</sup>But he that prophesies, to men he
speaks edification, and exhortation, and comfort. <sup>4</sup>He
that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that
prophesies edifies the church.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>I would that ye should all speak with
tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy; for greater is he that
prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret,
that the church may receive edification.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And now, brethren, if I come to you
speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall
speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in
prophesying, or in teaching? <sup>7</sup>And things without life
giving sound, whether pipe or harp, yet if they give no distinction
in the sounds, how shall that be known which is piped or harped?
<sup>8</sup>For if a trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall
prepare himself for battle? <sup>9</sup>So also ye, if ye utter not
by the tongue words easily understood, how shall that be known
which is spoken? For ye will be speaking into the air.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>So many, it may be, are the kinds of
speaking sounds in the world, and none is without significance.
<sup>11</sup>If then I know not the meaning of the sound, I shall
be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks a barbarian
to me. <sup>12</sup>So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual
gifts, seek that ye may abound in them to the edification of the
church.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Wherefore let him that speaks in an
unknown tongue pray that he may interpret. <sup>14</sup>For if I
pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is
unfruitful. <sup>15</sup>What then? I will pray with the spirit,
and I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the
spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
<sup>16</sup>Else, if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall
he that occupies the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy
giving of thanks, since he knows not what thou sayest?
<sup>17</sup>For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is
not edified.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>I thank God, I speak with tongues more
than ye all. <sup>19</sup>Yet in the church I would rather speak
five words with my understanding, that I may also instruct others,
than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Brethren, be not children in your
understandings; but in malice be as children, but in your
understandings be men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>In the law it is written:</p>
<p class="pp1">For with men of other tongues, and with strange
lips,</p>
<p class="pp1">I will speak to this people;</p>
<p class="pp1">And not even so will they hearken to me, saith the
Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>So that the tongues are for a sign, not
to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is
not for the unbelieving, but for those who believe.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>If therefore the whole church is come
together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come
in those who are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that
ye are mad? <sup>24</sup>But if all prophesy, and there come in one
that is an unbeliever, or unlearned, he is convicted by all, he is
judged by all. <sup>25</sup>The secrets of his heart are made
manifest; and so falling on his face he will worship God, reporting
that God is in truth among you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>How is it then, brethren? When ye come
together, each of you has a psalm, has an instruction, has a
tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be
done to edification. <sup>27</sup>If any one speaks in an unknown
tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in turn; and
let one interpret. <sup>28</sup>But if there be no interpreter, let
him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and
to God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>And of prophets, let two or three
speak, and the others judge. <sup>30</sup>But if a revelation be
made to another sitting by, let the first be silent.
<sup>31</sup>For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may
learn, and all be comforted. <sup>32</sup>And the spirits of the
prophets are subject to the prophets. <sup>33</sup>For God is not a
God of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the
saints.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>34</sup>Let your women keep silence in the
churches; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but they are to
be in subjection, as the law also says. <sup>35</sup>And if they
wish to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home; for it
is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>Did the word of God come forth from
you? Or came it unto you alone? <sup>37</sup>If any one thinks
himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the
things which I write to you are the Lord's commandments.
<sup>38</sup>But if any one is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
<sup>39</sup>Wherefore, brethren, desire earnestly the gift of
prophecy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. <sup>40</sup>But
let all things be done decently and in order.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> I make
known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which
also ye received, in which also ye stand; <sup>2</sup>through which
also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word with which I preached
to you, unless ye believed in vain.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>For I delivered to you first of all what
I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures; <sup>4</sup>and that he was buried, and that he has
risen on the third day according to the Scriptures; <sup>5</sup>and
that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve; <sup>6</sup>after
that, he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once; of whom
the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep.
<sup>7</sup>After that, he appeared to James; then to all the
apostles. <sup>8</sup>And last of all he appeared to me also, as
the one born out of due time. <sup>9</sup>For I am the least of the
apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I
persecuted the church of God. <sup>10</sup>But by the grace of God
I am what I am; and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in
vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but
the grace of God which was with me. <sup>11</sup>Therefore whether
it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Now if Christ is preached that he has
risen from the dead, how say some among you that there is no
resurrection of the dead? <sup>13</sup>But if there is no
resurrection of the dead, then neither has Christ risen;
<sup>14</sup>and if Christ has not risen, then is our preaching
vain, and vain also your faith. <sup>15</sup>And we are also found
false witnesses of God; because we testified of God, that he raised
up Christ; whom he raised not, if it be so that the dead rise not.
<sup>16</sup>For if the dead rise not, neither has Christ risen;
<sup>17</sup>and if Christ has not risen, your faith is vain; ye
are yet in your sins. <sup>18</sup>Then also they who have fallen
asleep in Christ have perished. <sup>19</sup>If in this life only
we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>But now Christ has risen from the dead,
the first-fruits of those who sleep. <sup>21</sup>For since by man
came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
<sup>22</sup>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be
made alive. <sup>23</sup>But each in his own order; Christ the
first-fruits; afterward they who are Christ's at his coming.
<sup>24</sup>Then comes the end, when he delivers up the kingdom to
God, the Father; when he shall have done away all rule, and all
authority and power. <sup>25</sup>For he must reign, <span class=
"ot">till he has put all enemies under his feet.</span>
<sup>26</sup>As the last enemy, Death shall be done away. For
<span class="ot">he subjected all things under his feet.</span>
<sup>27</sup>But when he says, <span class="ot">All things are
subjected,</span> it is manifest that he is excepted, who subjected
all things to him. <sup>28</sup>And when all things shall be
subjected to him, then will also the Son himself be subject to him
who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>Else what shall they do who are
immersed for the dead? If the dead rise not at all, why are they
then immersed for them? <sup>30</sup>Why also are we in peril every
hour? <sup>31</sup>I protest by my glorying in you, which I have in
Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. <sup>32</sup>If after the
manner of men I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what is the
profit to me, if the dead rise not?</p>
<p class="pp4">Let us eat and drink;</p>
<p class="pp4">For to-morrow we die.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>33</sup>Be not deceived; evil communications
corrupt good manners. <sup>34</sup>Awake to righteousness, and sin
not; for some have not the knowledge of God. I say it to your
shame.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>But some one will say: How do the dead
rise? And with what kind of body do they come? <sup>36</sup>Thou
fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die;
<sup>37</sup>and what thou sowest, not the body that shall be
sowest thou, but bare grain, perchance of wheat, or of some other
grain. <sup>38</sup>But God gives it a body as it pleased him, and
to each of the seeds its own body.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>All flesh is not the same flesh; but
there is one flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of
fishes, another of birds. <sup>40</sup>There are also heavenly
bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one,
and that of the earthly is another. <sup>41</sup>There is one glory
of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
stars; for star differs from star in glory.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>42</sup>So also is the resurrection of the
dead. It is sown in corruption, it rises in incorruption.
<sup>43</sup>It is sown in dishonor, it rises in glory. It is sown
in weakness, it rises in power. <sup>44</sup>It is sown a natural
body, it rises a spiritual body.</p>
<p class="pin">If there is a natural body, there is also a
spiritual. <sup>45</sup>So also it is written: <span class="ot">The
first man Adam was made a living soul;</span> the last Adam a
life-giving spirit. <sup>46</sup>But the spiritual is not first,
but the natural; and afterward the spiritual. <sup>47</sup>The
first man was of the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.
<sup>48</sup>As was the earthy, such are they also that are earthy;
and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
<sup>49</sup>And as we bore the image of the earthy, we shall also
bear the image of the heavenly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>50</sup>And this I say, brethren, that flesh
and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption
inherit incorruption. <sup>51</sup>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We
shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, <sup>52</sup>in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the
trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and
we shall be changed. <sup>53</sup>For this corruptible must put on
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
<sup>54</sup>And when this corruptible shall have put on
incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then
will be brought to pass the saying, that is written: <span class=
"ot">Death is swallowed up in victory.</span> <sup>55</sup>Where, O
death, is thy sting? Where, O death, is thy victory?
<sup>56</sup>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is
the law. <sup>57</sup>But thanks be to God, who gives us the
victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>58</sup>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be
steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of
Galatia, so also do ye. <sup>2</sup>On each first day of the week,
let every one of you lay by him in store, according as he is
prospered, that there may be no collections when I come.
<sup>3</sup>And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve, them I
will send with letters to carry your benefaction to Jerusalem.
<sup>4</sup>And if it be worthy of my going also, they shall go
with me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And I will come to you, when I shall
pass through Macedonia. For I pass through Macedonia;

winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I
go. <sup>7</sup>For I wish not to see you now, in passing; for I
hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord permit.
<sup>8</sup>But I shall remain at Ephesus until the Pentecost.
<sup>9</sup>For a great and effectual door is open to me, and there
are many adversaries.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Now if Timothy come, see that he may be
with you without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, as I also
do. <sup>11</sup>Let no one therefore despise him; but send him

the brethren.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And concerning Apollos the brother, I
besought him much to come to you with the brethren; and it was not
at all his will to come at this time, but he will come when he
shall have a convenient time.</p>

you like men, be strong. <sup>14</sup>Let all your acts be done in
love.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And I beseech you, brethren, (ye know
the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and
that they devoted themselves to the service of the saints,)

<h1><a name="b47" id="b47">THE SECOND LETTER OF PAUL TO THE
CORINTHIANS.</a></h1>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;P<span class=
"sc">aul</span>, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with
all the saints who are in all Achaia: <sup>2</sup>Grace to you and
peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all
consolation; <sup>4</sup>who consoles us in all our affliction,
that we may be able to console those who are in any affliction, by
the consolation wherewith we ourselves are consoled by God.
<sup>5</sup>Because, as the sufferings of Christ abound toward us,
so through Christ abounds also our consolation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>But whether we are afflicted, it is for
your consolation and salvation, which is effective in the endurance
of the same sufferings which we also suffer; or whether we are
consoled, it is for your consolation and salvation. <sup>7</sup>And
our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of
the sufferings, so are ye also of the consolation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>For we would not, brethren, that ye
should be ignorant of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that
we were exceedingly oppressed, above our strength, so that we
despaired even of life. <sup>9</sup>Yea, we ourselves had in
ourselves the sentence of death, that we should not trust in
ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; <sup>10</sup>who
delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom is
our hope that he will still deliver; <sup>11</sup>ye also helping
together on our behalf by your supplication, that for the mercy
bestowed on us through many persons, thanks may be given by many on
our behalf.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>For our glorying is this, the testimony
of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not in
fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, did we deport ourselves in
the world, and more abundantly toward you. <sup>13</sup>For we
write no other things to you, than what ye read or even
acknowledge, and I trust ye will acknowledge even to the end;
<sup>14</sup>as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are
your glorying, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord
Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And in this confidence I was desirous
to come to you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
<sup>16</sup>and to pass by you into Macedonia, and from Macedonia
to come again to you, and by you to be brought on my way to Judea.
<sup>17</sup>When therefore I purposed this, did I act with levity?
Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,
that with me there should be the yea, yea, and the nay, nay?
<sup>18</sup>But God is faithful, our word to you is not yea and
nay. <sup>19</sup>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was
preached among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not
made yea and nay, but has been made yea in him. <sup>20</sup>For
however many are the promises of God, in him is the yea, and in him
the Amen, to the glory of God through us. <sup>21</sup>Now he who
establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;
<sup>22</sup>he who also sealed us, and gave the earnest of the
Spirit in our hearts.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>But I invoke God for a witness upon my
soul, that to spare you I came not yet to Corinth. <sup>24</sup>Not
that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy;
for in faith ye stand fast.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> I
determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in
sorrow. <sup>2</sup>For if I make you sorry, who then is he that
makes me glad, but the same who is made sorry by me?
<sup>3</sup>And I wrote this very thing to you, that I might not,
when I came, have sorrow from those of whom I ought to have joy;
having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
<sup>4</sup>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote
to you, with many tears; not that ye might have sorrow, but that ye
might know the love which I have more abundantly toward you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>But if any has caused sorrow, he has not
caused sorrow to me, but in part (that I be not too severe on him)
to you all. <sup>6</sup>Sufficient for such a one is this
punishment, which was inflicted by the many. <sup>7</sup>So that,
on the contrary, ye ought rather to forgive and console him, lest
perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
<sup>8</sup>Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>For to this end also I wrote, that I
might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
<sup>10</sup>To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also; for what
I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes I
forgave it in the person of Christ, <sup>11</sup>that no advantage
might be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his
devices.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And when I came to Troas to preach the
good news of Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,
<sup>13</sup>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus
my brother; but taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.
<sup>14</sup>But thanks be to God, who always causes us to triumph
in Christ, and makes manifest by us in every place the savor of the
knowledge of him. <sup>15</sup>Because we are to God a sweet savor
of Christ, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;
<sup>16</sup>to the one a savor of death unto death, to the other a
savor of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
<sup>17</sup>For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of
God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God we
speak in Christ.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;D<span class="sc">o</span> we again
begin to commend ourselves? Or need we, as some, letters of
commendation to you, or of commendation from you? <sup>2</sup>Ye
are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
<sup>3</sup>being made manifest that ye are a letter of Christ
ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshly tablets of the
heart.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And such confidence have we through
Christ, toward God. <sup>5</sup>Not that we are sufficient of
ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is
of God; <sup>6</sup>who also made us sufficient as ministers of a
new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter
kills, but the spirit makes alive.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>But if the ministration of death,
engraven with letters in stones, was made glorious, so that the
sons of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for
the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away;
<sup>8</sup>how shall not the ministration of the spirit be more
glorious? <sup>9</sup>For if the ministration of condemnation is
glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness abound in
glory. <sup>10</sup>For even that which was made glorious has no
glory in this respect, on account of the glory that excels.
<sup>11</sup>For if that which is done away was glorious, much more
that which abides is glorious.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Having therefore such hope, we use
great plainness of speech; <sup>13</sup>and not as Moses put a vail
over his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly
look on the end of that which was to be done away. <sup>14</sup>But
their understandings were hardened; for until this day the same
vail on the reading of the old covenant remains, not being taken
away; which vail is done away in Christ<sup><a href="#r480314" id=
"f480314" title="see footnote" name="f480314">14</a></sup>.
<sup>15</sup>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, a vail
lies upon their heart. <sup>16</sup>But whenever it turns to the
Lord, the vail is taken away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. <sup>18</sup>But we
all, with unvailed face beholding in a mirror the glory of the
Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as
by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">herefore</span>,
having this ministry, as we received mercy, we faint not.
<sup>2</sup>But we renounced the hidden things of shame, not
walking in craftiness, nor falsifying the word of God; but, by the
manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's
conscience in the sight of God. <sup>3</sup>But if our gospel is
vailed, it is vailed in those who perish; <sup>4</sup>in whom the
god of this world blinded the understandings of the unbelieving,
that they should not discern the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God<sup><a href="#r480404" id=
"f480404" title="see footnote" name="f480404">4</a></sup>.
<sup>5</sup>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord;
and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. <sup>6</sup>Because
it is God, who commands light to shine out of darkness; who shined
in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of
God in the face of Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>But we have this treasure in earthen
vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be God's,
and not of us; <sup>8</sup>being pressed in every way, yet not
straitened; perplexed, yet not despairing; <sup>9</sup>persecuted,
yet not forsaken; cast down, yet not destroyed; <sup>10</sup>always
bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that also the life of
Jesus might be made manifest in our body. <sup>11</sup>For we who
live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life
also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
<sup>12</sup>So that death works in us, but life in you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>But having the same spirit of faith,
according to what is written, <span class="ot">I believed,
therefore did I speak</span>, we also believe, therefore also
speak; <sup>14</sup>knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus
will raise up us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.
<sup>15</sup>For all things are for your sakes; that the grace,
abounding through the greater number, might make the thanksgiving
more abundant, to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>For which cause we faint not; but
though our outward man perishes, yet the inward man is renewed day
by day: <sup>17</sup>For our light affliction, which is but for a
moment, works out for us a far more exceeding, an eternal weight of
glory; <sup>18</sup>while we look not at the things which are seen,
but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen
are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class=
"sc">or</span> we know that, if our earthly house of the
tabernacle<sup><a href="#r480501" id="f480501" title="see footnote"
name="f480501">1</a></sup> were dissolved, we have a building of
God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
<sup>2</sup>For in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with
our house which is from heaven; <sup>3</sup>seeing that we shall be
found clothed, not naked<sup><a href="#r480503" id="f480503" title=
"see footnote" name="f480503">3</a></sup>. <sup>4</sup>For we who
are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; in that we do not
desire to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon, that what is mortal
might be swallowed up by life.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Now he who wrought us out for this very
thing is God, who also gave to us the earnest of the Spirit.
<sup>6</sup>Being therefore always confident, and knowing that
while at home in the body we are absent from the Lord,
<sup>7</sup>(for we walk by faith, not by sight), <sup>8</sup>we
are confident, and are well pleased rather to be absent from the
body, and to be at home with the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Wherefore we also strive, that, whether
at home or absent, we may be well pleasing to him. <sup>10</sup>For
we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ;
that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to
the things which he did, whether good or bad.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord,
we persuade men; but to God we have been made manifest, and I hope
that we have been made manifest also in your consciences.
<sup>12</sup>For we are not again commending ourselves to you, but
giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have
somewhat to answer those who glory in appearance and not in heart.
<sup>13</sup>For whether we were beside ourselves, it was for God;
or whether we are of sound mind, it is for you. <sup>14</sup>For
the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judged, that if
one died for all, then they all died. <sup>15</sup>And he died for
all, that they who live should live no longer to themselves, but to
him who for them died and rose again. <sup>16</sup>So that we
henceforth know no one according to the flesh; and if also we have
known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we no longer know him.
<sup>17</sup>So that if any one is in Christ, he is a new creature;
the old things passed away; behold, all things have become new.
<sup>18</sup>And all things are of God, who reconciled us to
himself through Christ, and gave to us the ministry of
reconciliation; <sup>19</sup>as that God was in Christ reconciling
a world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and
having committed to us the word of reconciliation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>We are then ambassadors on behalf of
Christ<sup><a href="#r480520" id="f480520" title="see footnote"
name="f480520">20</a></sup>, as though God were beseeching by us;
on behalf of Christ we pray: Be reconciled to God! <sup>21</sup>Him
who knew not sin he made to be sin for us, that we might become
God's righteousness in him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span>, as workers
together with him, we also beseech you that ye receive not the
grace of God in vain; <sup>2</sup>(for he says:</p>
<p class="pp3">In an accepted time I heard thee,</p>
<p class="pp3">And in the day of salvation I helped thee;</p>
<p class="pnn">behold, now is the well accepted time, behold, now
is the day of salvation;) <sup>3</sup>giving no cause of offense in
anything, that the ministry be not blamed; <sup>4</sup>but as God's
ministers, commending ourselves in everything, in much patience, in
afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, <sup>5</sup>in stripes,
in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
<sup>6</sup>in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in
kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, <sup>7</sup>in the
word of truth, in the power of God, by the armor of righteousness
on the right hand and on the left, <sup>8</sup>through glory and
dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and
true; <sup>9</sup>as unknown, and well known; as dying, and,
behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; <sup>10</sup>as
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as
having nothing, and possessing all things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>O Corinthians, our mouth is open to
you, our heart is enlarged. <sup>12</sup>Ye are not straitened in
us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. <sup>13</sup>Now as a
recompense in the same kind (I speak as to my children), be ye also
enlarged.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Be not yoked unequally with
unbelievers; for what fellowship has righteousness with
lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?
<sup>15</sup>And what concord has Christ with Belial? Or what part
has a believer with an unbeliever? <sup>16</sup>And what agreement
has the temple of God with idols? For ye are a temple of the living
God; as God said: <span class="ot">I will dwell in them, and walk
among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a
people.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Wherefore, <span class="ot">come out
from among them, and be separated,</span> saith the Lord,
<span class="ot">and touch not anything unclean; and I will receive
you,</span> <sup>18</sup><span class="ot">and will be to you a
Father, and ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord
Almighty.</span></p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;H<span class="sc">aving</span>
therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves
from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in
the fear of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>Receive us; we wronged no one, we
corrupted no one, we defrauded no one. <sup>3</sup>I say it not for
condemnation; for I have before said, that ye are in our hearts, to
die together and to live together. <sup>4</sup>Great is my
confidence toward you, great is my glorying on account of you; I am
filled with the consolation, I am made to abound with the joy, in
all our affliction.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>For indeed, when we were come into
Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in every
way; without were fightings, within were fears. <sup>6</sup>But
God, who consoles those who are cast down, consoled us by the
coming of Titus; <sup>7</sup>and not by his coming only, but also
by the consolation with which he was consoled in you, when he told
us your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I
rejoiced the more. <sup>8</sup>Because, though I made you sorry
with the letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it; for I
perceive that that letter made you sorry, though but for a season.
<sup>9</sup>Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye
were made sorry unto repentance; for ye were made sorry after a
godly manner, that ye might in nothing receive harm from us.
<sup>10</sup>For godly sorrow works repentance unto salvation, not
to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world works out death.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>For behold this very thing, that ye
were made sorry after a godly manner, what earnestness it wrought
in you; yea, what clearing of yourselves; yea, what indignation;
yea, what fear; yea, what longing desire; yea, what zeal; yea, what
avenging! In every thing ye commended yourselves as pure in the
matter. <sup>12</sup>So then, though I wrote to you, it was not on
account of him who did the wrong, nor of him who suffered wrong,
but that your care for us might be made manifest to you in the
sight of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>For this cause we were consoled; but in
our consolation<sup><a href="#r480713" id="f480713" title=
"see footnote" name="f480713">13</a></sup>, we rejoiced abundantly
more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by
you all. <sup>14</sup>For if in any thing I have boasted to him of
you, I was not made ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in
truth, so also our boasting before Titus was found to be truth.
<sup>15</sup>And his tender affection is more abundantly toward
you, while he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and
trembling ye received him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>I rejoice, that in every thing I have
confidence in you.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> we made
known to you, brethren, the grace of God which has been bestowed on
the churches of Macedonia; <sup>2</sup>that in much trial of
affliction was the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty
abounded to the riches of their liberality. <sup>3</sup>For
according to their power, I bear witness, and beyond their power,
they were willing of themselves; <sup>4</sup>with much entreaty
beseeching of us the grace, and the participation in the
ministering to the saints; <sup>5</sup>and not as we expected, but
themselves they gave first to the Lord, and to us by the will of
God. <sup>6</sup>So that we exhorted Titus, that as he had before
begun, so he would also finish among you this grace also.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>But, as in everything ye abound, in
faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all diligence, and your
love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. <sup>8</sup>I
say it not by way of command, but through the forwardness of others
proving also the sincerity of your love. <sup>9</sup>For ye know
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet
for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be
rich. <sup>10</sup>And I give an opinion in this matter; for this
is expedient for you, who began before others, not only to do, but
also to will, a year ago. <sup>11</sup>And now perform the doing of
it also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be
the performance according to what ye have.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>For if there be first the willing mind,
it is accepted according to what a man has, not according to what
he has not. <sup>13</sup>For it is not that others may be eased,
and ye burdened; <sup>14</sup>but, by the rule of equality, at this
present time your abundance being a supply for their want, that
also their abundance may be a supply for your want, that there may
be equality; as it is written: <sup>15</sup>He that gathered much
had nothing over, and he that gathered little did not lack.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>But thanks be to God, who put the same
earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. <sup>17</sup>For he
accepted indeed the exhortation; but being very zealous, he went to
you of his own accord. <sup>18</sup>And together with him we sent
the brother, whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the
churches; <sup>19</sup>and not that only, but who was also
appointed by the churches, as our fellow-traveler with this
gift<sup><a href="#r480819" id="f480819" title="see footnote" name=
"f480819">19</a></sup> which is administered by us, to further the
glory of the Lord, and our zeal; <sup>20</sup>being careful of
this, that no one should blame us in this abundance which is
administered by us; <sup>21</sup>for we provide for what is
honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight
of men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And we sent with them our brother, whom
we have often in many things proved to be diligent, but now much
more diligent, through the great confidence which he has toward
you. <sup>23</sup>As to Titus, he is my partner, and in regard to
you a fellow-laborer; as to our brethren, they are messengers of
the churches, the glory of Christ. <sup>24</sup>Therefore show
toward them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and
of our boasting on your behalf.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class="sc">or</span> concerning
the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to
you. <sup>2</sup>For I know your readiness of mind, of which I
boast for you to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared
since a year ago; and your zeal stirred up the greater part of
them. <sup>3</sup>But I sent the brethren, that our boasting of you
might not be made in vain in this respect; that, as I said, ye may
be prepared; <sup>4</sup>lest haply, if Macedonians come with me,
and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to
shame in respect to this confidence.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>I thought it necessary, therefore, to
exhort the brethren, that they should go before to you, and make up
beforehand your bounty before promised, that this may be ready, in
manner as a bounty and not as covetousness. <sup>6</sup>But as to
this, he that sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly; and he that
sows with blessings shall also reap with blessings; <sup>7</sup>but
each as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity,
for God loves a cheerful giver.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And God is able to make every grace
abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in
everything, may abound toward every good work; <sup>9</sup>(as it
is written:</p>
<p class="pp2">He dispersed abroad, he gave to the poor;</p>
<p class="pp2">His righteousness abides forever;)</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>10</sup>and he who supplies seed to the sower
and bread for food, will supply and multiply your seed sown, and
increase the fruits of your righteousness; <sup>11</sup>being
enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us
thanksgiving to God. <sup>12</sup>Because the ministration of this
service not only supplies the wants of the saints, but also abounds
through many thanksgivings to God; <sup>13</sup>while by the proof
of this ministration they glorify God for the obedience to your
profession of the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of the
contribution to them, and to all; <sup>14</sup>they also, with
supplication for you, longing after you on account of the exceeding
grace of God in you. <sup>15</sup>Thanks be to God for his
unspeakable gift!</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class=
"sc">ow</span> I, Paul, myself beseech you by the meekness and
gentleness of Christ, who in presence indeed am lowly among you,
but being absent am bold toward you; <sup>2</sup>but I entreat,
that I may not when I am present be bold with that confidence,
wherewith I think to be bold against some, who think of us as
walking according to the flesh. <sup>3</sup>For though walking in
the flesh, we do not war after the flesh; <sup>4</sup>(for the
weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but mighty before God to
the pulling down of strongholds) <sup>5</sup>casting down
imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the
knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the
obedience of Christ; <sup>6</sup>and being in readiness to punish
every disobedience, when your obedience is made perfect.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Do ye look on things after the outward
appearance? If any man trusts to himself that he is Christ's, let
him of himself consider this again, that, as he is Christ's, so
also are we. <sup>8</sup>For even if I should boast somewhat more
abundantly of our authority, which the Lord gave us for
edification, and not for your destruction<sup><a href="#r481008"
id="f481008" title="see footnote" name="f481008">8</a></sup>, I
shall not be put to shame; <sup>9</sup>that I may not seem as if I
would terrify you by my letters. <sup>10</sup>For his letters, says
one, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and
his speech contemptible. <sup>11</sup>Let such a one consider this,
that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such will we be
also in deed when present.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>For we venture not to reckon ourselves
among, or to compare ourselves with, some of those who commend
themselves; but they, measuring themselves among themselves, and
comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise.
<sup>13</sup>But we will not boast of things without measure, but
according to the measure of the line which God apportioned to us, a
measure to reach even to you. <sup>14</sup>For we do not stretch
ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not to you; for
as far as to you also did we come, in the gospel of Christ;
<sup>15</sup>not boasting of things without measure in other men's
labors; but having hope, when your faith increases, that we shall
be enlarged among you according to our line abundantly,
<sup>16</sup>to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, not to
make our boast, in another's line, of things made ready to our
hand. <sup>17</sup>But he that boasts, let him boast in the Lord.
<sup>18</sup>For not he that commends himself is approved, but he
whom the Lord commends.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">ould</span> that ye
could bear with me in a little folly! Nay, ye do bear with me.
<sup>2</sup>For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy; for I
espoused you to one husband, that I may present a chaste virgin to
Christ. <sup>3</sup>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent
beguiled Eve by his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted
from your simplicity toward Christ. <sup>4</sup>For if indeed he
that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we preached not, or if ye
receive a different spirit, which ye received not, or a different
gospel, which ye accepted not, ye might well bear with it.
<sup>5</sup>For I reckon that I am in no respect behind these
overmuch apostles. <sup>6</sup>And though I be rude in speech, yet
not in knowledge; but in everything we have been made manifest
among all, in respect to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Did I commit an offense in abasing
myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the
gospel of God without charge. <sup>8</sup>I robbed other churches,
taking wages of them, in order to do you service. <sup>9</sup>And
when I was present with you, and in want, I was a charge to no one;
for what was lacking to me the brethren who came from Macedonia
supplied; and in every thing I kept myself from being burdensome to
you, and so will keep myself.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>As the truth of Christ is in me, this
boasting shall not be shut up against me in the regions of Achaia.
<sup>11</sup>Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knows.
<sup>12</sup>But what I do, and will do, is that I may cut off the
occasion of those who desire an occasion, that wherein they boast
they may be found even as we. <sup>13</sup>For such are false
apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles
of Christ. <sup>14</sup>And no wonder; for Satan himself transforms
himself into an angel of light. <sup>15</sup>It is no great thing
then, if also his ministers transform themselves as ministers of
righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>I say again, let no one think me
foolish; but if it can not be so, yet receive me even if as
foolish, that I too may boast myself a little. <sup>17</sup>What I
speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this
confidence of boasting. <sup>18</sup>Seeing that many boast after
the flesh, I also will boast. <sup>19</sup>For ye gladly bear with
the foolish, being yourselves wise. <sup>20</sup>For ye bear with
it, if one brings you into bondage, if one devours you, if one
takes you, if one exalts himself, if one smites you on the
face.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>I say it as a reproach, that we were
weak. But in whatever any one is bold (I say it in foolishness), I
also am bold. <sup>22</sup>Are they Hebrews? So am I Are they
Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's seed? So am I.
<sup>23</sup>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as beside
myself,) I am more; in labors more abundantly, in stripes above
measure, in prisons more abundantly, in deaths often;
<sup>24</sup>of the Jews five times I received forty stripes save
one; <sup>25</sup>thrice I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned;
thrice I suffered shipwreck; a night and a day I have spent in the
deep; <sup>26</sup>by journeyings often, by perils of rivers, by
perils of robbers, by perils from my countrymen, by perils from the
heathen, by perils in the city, by perils in the wilderness, by
perils in the sea, by perils among false brethren; <sup>27</sup>by
weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
<sup>28</sup>Beside those things that are without, there is that
which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
<sup>29</sup>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I
do not burn? <sup>30</sup>If I must needs boast, I will boast of
things which belong to my infirmity. <sup>31</sup>God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forevermore, knows that I
lie not. <sup>32</sup>In Damascus, the governor under Aretas the
king kept guard over the city of the Damascenes, wishing to
apprehend me; <sup>33</sup>and through a window I was let down in a
basket through the wall, and escaped his hands.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">o</span> boast is
surely not expedient for me; for I will come to visions and
revelations of the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>I know a man in Christ, above fourteen
years ago (whether in the body I know not, or whether out of the
body I know not, God knows) such a one caught up even to the third
heaven. <sup>3</sup>And I know such a man (whether in the body or
without the body I know not, God knows), <sup>4</sup>that he was
caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is
not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Of such a one I will boast; but of
myself I will not boast, save in my infirmities. <sup>6</sup>For if
I should desire to boast, I shall not be foolish, for I shall speak
truth; but I forbear, lest any one should reckon of me above what
he sees me to be, or hears from me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And that I might not be exalted overmuch
through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a
thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I might
not be exalted overmuch. <sup>8</sup>Concerning this I besought the
Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. <sup>9</sup>And he said
to me: My grace is sufficient for thee; for my power is made
perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in
my infirmities, that the power of Christ may abide upon me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Wherefore I take pleasure in
infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in
distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then I am
powerful.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>I have become foolish; ye compelled me.
For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I
behind these overmuch apostles, though I am nothing.
<sup>12</sup>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you
in all patience, by signs, and wonders, and miracles.
<sup>13</sup>For what is there, wherein ye were inferior to the
rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a charge to you?
Forgive me this wrong.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Behold, I am ready to come to you the
third time; and I will not be a charge to you; for I seek not
yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the
parents, but the parents for the children. <sup>15</sup>And I will
most gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more
abundantly I love you, the less I am loved. <sup>16</sup>But be it
so, I was not myself a charge to you<sup><a href="#r481216" id=
"f481216" title="see footnote" name="f481216">16</a></sup>; but
yet, being crafty, I caught you with guile. <sup>17</sup>Did I make
gain of you, by any of those whom I have sent to you?
<sup>18</sup>I exhorted Titus [to go], and sent with him the
brother. Did Titus make gain of you? Did we not walk in the same
spirit; did we not in the same steps?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Do ye again suppose that we are
excusing ourselves to you<sup><a href="#r481219" id="f481219"
title="see footnote" name="f481219">19</a></sup>? Before God in
Christ we speak; and all, beloved, for your edification.
<sup>20</sup>For I fear, lest haply, when I come, I shall find you
not such as I would, and I too shall be found by you such as ye
would not; lest there be wranglings, envyings, wraths, rivalries,
backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; <sup>21</sup>lest,
when I come again, my God shall humble me among you, and I shall
bewail many of those who have sinned before, and repented not of
the uncleanness, and fornication, and wantonness, which they
committed.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">his</span> third
time I am coming to you. <span class="ot">In the mouth of two
witnesses, and of three, shall every word be established.</span>
<sup>2</sup>I have before said, and now say beforehand, as when
present the second time, so also now when absent, to those who
heretofore have sinned, and to all the rest, that if I come again I
will not spare; <sup>3</sup>since ye seek a proof of Christ
speaking in me, who toward you is not weak, but is mighty in you.
<sup>4</sup>For even if he was crucified through weakness, yet he
lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we
shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Try your own selves, whether ye are in
the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, that
Jesus Christ is in you, except ye are reprobate? <sup>6</sup>But I
trust that ye shall know, that we are not reprobate.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Now I pray to God that ye do no evil;
not that we should appear approved, but that ye may do what is
good, though we be as reprobate. <sup>8</sup>For we have no power
against the truth, but for the truth. <sup>9</sup>For we are glad,
when we are weak, and ye are powerful; this also we pray for, even
your perfection.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>For this cause I write these things
being absent, that when present I may not use sharpness, according
to the power which the Lord gave me for edification, and not for
destruction.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Finally, brethren, farewell. Be
perfect, be of good comfort, be of the same mind, be at peace; and
the God of love and peace will be with you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Salute one another with a holy kiss.
<sup>13</sup>All the saints salute you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you
all.</p>

<h1><a name="b48" id="b48">THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE
GALATIANS.</a></h1>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;P<span class=
"sc">aul</span>, an apostle, not from men, neither through man, but
through Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised him from the
dead, <sup>2</sup>and all the brethren who are with me, to the
churches of Galatia: <sup>3</sup>Grace to you, and peace, from God
the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ; <sup>4</sup>who gave himself
for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil
world, according to the will of God and our Father; <sup>5</sup>to
whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>I marvel that ye are so soon removing
from him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different
gospel; <sup>7</sup>which is not another, except that there are
some who trouble you, and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.
<sup>8</sup>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach
a gospel to you contrary to that which we preached to you, let him
be accursed. <sup>9</sup>As we have said before, so I now say
again, if any one preaches a gospel to you contrary to that which
ye received, let him be accursed. <sup>10</sup>For do I now seek
the favor of men or of God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I
were still pleasing men, I should not be Christ's servant.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Now I make known to you, brethren, that
the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man;
<sup>12</sup>for I also did not receive it from man, nor was I
taught it, but through the revelation of Jesus Christ.
<sup>13</sup>For ye heard of my conduct formerly in Judaism; that
beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and was destroying
it, <sup>14</sup>and pressed forward in Judaism beyond many
companions of the same age in my nation, being more exceedingly a
zealot for the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>But when it pleased God, who set me
apart from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,
<sup>16</sup>to reveal his Son in me, that I should make known the
glad news of him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not
with flesh and blood; <sup>17</sup>neither went up to Jerusalem to
those who were apostles before me, but went away<sup><a href=
"#r480117" id="f480117" title="see footnote" name=
"f480117">17</a></sup> into Arabia, and returned again to
Damascus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Then, after three years, I went up to
Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and remained with him
fifteen days. <sup>19</sup>But no other of the apostles did I see,
save James, the brother of the Lord. <sup>20</sup>Now as to the
things which I write to you, behold before God, I lie not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Afterward, I came into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia; <sup>22</sup>and was unknown by face to the
churches of Juda which were in Christ; <sup>23</sup>but they were
only hearing, that he who was once our persecutor now preaches the
faith which once he was destroying; <sup>24</sup>and they glorified
God in me.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">hen</span>, after
fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking
also Titus with me. <sup>2</sup>And I went up by revelation, and
communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles;
but privately, to those of reputation, lest by any means I should
run, or had run in vain. <sup>3</sup>But not even Titus, who was
with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised;
<sup>4</sup>and that because of the false brethren stealthily
brought in, who crept in to spy out our liberty which we have in
Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage; <sup>5</sup>to
whom not even for an hour did we yield by the [required]
submission, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
<sup>6</sup>But from those reputed to be something,&mdash;whatever
they were<sup><a href="#r480206" id="f480206" title="see footnote"
name="f480206">6</a></sup>, it matters not to me, God accepts not
man's person,&mdash;for to me those of reputation communicated
nothing in addition. <sup>7</sup>But, on the contrary, seeing that
I have been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as
Peter was with that of the circumcision; <sup>8</sup>(for he who
wrought for Peter in behalf of the apostleship of the circumcision,
wrought also for me in behalf of the Gentiles;) <sup>9</sup>and
having learned the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and
John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas right
hands of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to
the circumcision; <sup>10</sup>only, that we should remember the
poor, which very thing also I was forward to do.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I
withstood him to the face, because he was blamed. <sup>12</sup>For
before certain ones came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but
when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those
who were of the circumcision. <sup>13</sup>And the other Jews also
dissembled with him, so that Barnabas also was carried away with
their dissimulation. <sup>14</sup>But when I saw that they walk not
uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in
the presence of all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner
of Gentiles and not that of Jews, how dost thou compel the Gentiles
to become as Jews? <sup>15</sup>We are Jews by nature, and not
sinners from among the Gentiles; <sup>16</sup>but knowing that a
man is not justified by works of law, but through faith in Jesus
Christ, we also believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be
justified by faith in Christ, and not by works of law; because by
works of law no flesh shall be justified. <sup>17</sup>But if,
while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were
found sinners, is then Christ a minister of sin? Far be it!
<sup>18</sup>For if the things which I pulled down these I build up
again, I make myself a transgressor. <sup>19</sup>For I through law
died to law, that I might live to God. <sup>20</sup>I have been
crucified with Christ; and no longer do I live, but Christ lives in
me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in the faith
of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
<sup>21</sup>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if there be
righteousness through law, then Christ died without cause.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;O
<span class="sc">foolish</span> Galatians, who bewitched you,
before whose eyes Jesus Christ was evidently set forth<sup><a href=
"#r480301" id="f480301" title="see footnote" name=
"f480301">1</a></sup>, crucified among you? <sup>2</sup>This only I
desire to learn from you: Was it from works of law that ye received
the Spirit, or from the hearing of faith? <sup>3</sup>Are ye so
foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are ye now being made
perfect<sup><a href="#r480303" id="f480303" title="see footnote"
name="f480303">3</a></sup> with the flesh? <sup>4</sup>Did ye
suffer so many things in vain? If indeed it be in vain.
<sup>5</sup>Does he, therefore, who supplies to you the Spirit, and
works miracles among you<sup><a href="#r480305" id="f480305" title=
"see footnote" name="f480305">5</a></sup>, do it from works of law,
or from the hearing of faith? <sup>6</sup>As Abraham believed God,
and it was reckoned to him for righteousness. <sup>7</sup>Know then
that they who are of faith, these are sons of Abraham.
<sup>8</sup>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God justifies the
Gentiles by faith, announced beforehand the glad tidings to
Abraham, saying: In thee shall all the nations be blessed.
<sup>9</sup>So that they who are of faith are blessed with the
faithful Abraham.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>For as many as are of works of law are
under a curse; for it is written: <span class="ot">Cursed is every
one that continues not in all the things written in the book of the
law, to do them.</span> <sup>11</sup>And that in the law no one is
justified with God, is evident; because, <span class="ot">the just
shall live by faith.</span> <sup>12</sup>Now the law is not of
faith; but, <span class="ot">he that has done them shall live in
them.</span> <sup>13</sup>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the
law, having become a curse for us; because it is written:
<span class="ot">Cursed is every one that is hanged on a
tree;</span> <sup>14</sup>that unto the Gentiles the blessing of
Abraham might come in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the
promise of the Spirit through faith.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Brethren, I speak after the manner of
men. If a covenant has been confirmed, though it be a man's, no one
sets it aside, or adds thereto. <sup>16</sup>Now to Abraham were
the promises spoken, and to his seed. He says not, <span class=
"ot">and to seeds,</span> as concerning many; but as concerning
one, <span class="ot">and to thy seed,</span> which is Christ.
<sup>17</sup>But this I say, that a covenant before confirmed by
God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does
not annul, to make the promise of no effect. <sup>18</sup>For if
the inheritance is of law, it is no more of promise; but God has
freely given it to Abraham by promise.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>What then is the law? It was added
because of the transgressions, until the seed should come to whom
the promise has been made; having been ordained through angels, by
the hand of a mediator. <sup>20</sup>Now the mediator is not of
one; but God is one. <sup>21</sup>Is then the law against the
promises of God? Far be it! For if a law had been given which is
able to make alive, truly righteousness would have been of law.
<sup>22</sup>But the Scripture shut up all under sin, that the
promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who
believe. <sup>23</sup>But before faith came, we were guarded under
law, shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed.
<sup>24</sup>So that the law has become our schoolmaster, unto
Christ, that we might be justified by faith. <sup>25</sup>But faith
having come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
<sup>26</sup>For ye are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
<sup>27</sup>For all ye who were immersed unto Christ<sup><a href=
"#r480327" id="f480327" title="see footnote" name=
"f480327">27</a></sup>, did put on Christ. <sup>28</sup>There is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is no
male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
<sup>29</sup>And if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed,
heirs according to the promise.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> I say, as
long as the heir is a child, he differs in nothing from a servant
though he is lord of all; <sup>2</sup>but is under guardians and
stewards, until the time appointed by the father. <sup>3</sup>So
also we, when we were children, were held in bondage under the
elements<sup><a href="#r480403" id="f480403" title="see footnote"
name="f480403">3</a></sup> of the world. <sup>4</sup>But when the
fullness of the time came, God sent forth his son, born of a woman,
born under law, <sup>5</sup>that he might redeem those under law,
that we might receive the adoption of sons. <sup>6</sup>And because
ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,
crying, Abba, Father. <sup>7</sup>So that thou art no longer a
servant, but a son; and if a son, also an heir through God.
<sup>8</sup>But at that time indeed, when ye knew not God, ye
served those which are not in their nature gods. <sup>9</sup>But
now, after having known God, or rather having been known by God,
how is it that ye turn back again to the weak and poor
elements<sup><a href="#r480409" id="f480409" title="see footnote"
name="f480409">9</a></sup>, to which ye desire to be in bondage
again anew? <sup>10</sup>Do ye carefully observe days, and months,
and seasons, and years? <sup>11</sup>I am afraid of you, lest by
any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Become as I am, for I also became as ye
are, brethren, I beseech you. Ye injured me in nothing.
<sup>13</sup>Nay, ye know that by reason of weakness of the flesh I
preached the glad tidings to you the former time; <sup>14</sup>and
my trial<sup><a href="#r480414" id="f480414" title="see footnote"
name="f480414">14</a></sup>, which was in my flesh, ye despised not
nor spurned, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
<sup>15</sup>Where is<sup><a href="#r480415" id="f480415" title=
"see footnote" name="f480415">15</a></sup> then the happiness of
which ye spoke? For I bear you witness, that if possible, ye would
have plucked out your eyes, and given them to me. <sup>16</sup>So
then, have I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
<sup>17</sup>They zealously seek you, not well; but they wish to
exclude you, that ye may zealously seek them. <sup>18</sup>But it
is good to be zealously sought in a good cause always, and not only
when I am present with you. <sup>19</sup>My little children, of
whom I travail again in birth, until Christ be formed in you!
<sup>20</sup>And I could wish to be present with you now, and to
change my voice; for I am perplexed on account of you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Tell me, ye who desire to be under law,
do ye not hear the law? <sup>22</sup>For it is written, that
Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman, and one by the
freewoman. <sup>23</sup>But the one by the bondwoman was born after
the flesh, and the one by the freewoman through the promise.
<sup>24</sup>Which things are an allegory<sup><a href="#r480424"
id="f480424" title="see footnote" name="f480424">24</a></sup>. For
these women are two covenants, one from mount Sinai, bearing
children into bondage, <sup>25</sup>which is Hagar (for the word
Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia), and answers to the Jerusalem that
now is, for she is in bondage with her children. <sup>26</sup>But
the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us
all<sup><a href="#r480426" id="f480426" title="see footnote" name=
"f480426">26</a></sup>. <sup>27</sup>For it is written:</p>
<p class="pp1">Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;</p>
<p class="pp1">Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not;</p>
<p class="pp1">Because many are the children of the desolate,
rather than of her who has the husband.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>But ye, brethren, after the manner of
Isaac, are children of promise. <sup>29</sup>But as then, the one
born after the flesh persecuted the one born after the spirit, so
also is it now. <sup>30</sup>But what says the Scripture?
<span class="ot">Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of
the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the
free-woman.</span> <sup>31</sup>So then, brethren, we are not
children of a bondwoman, but of the freewoman.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;S<span class=
"sc">tand</span> fast, therefore, in the liberty with which Christ
made us free, and be not again entangled with the yoke of bondage.
<sup>2</sup>Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye be circumcised,
Christ shall profit you nothing. <sup>3</sup>Now I testify again to
every man who becomes circumcised, that he is a debtor to keep the
whole law. <sup>4</sup>Ye are separated from Christ, whoever of you
are justified in the law; ye are fallen away from grace.
<sup>5</sup>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of
righteousness by faith. <sup>6</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither
circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith
working by love.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Ye were running well; who hindered you,
that ye should not obey the truth? <sup>8</sup>The persuasion is
not from him who calls you. <sup>9</sup>A little leaven leavens the
whole lump. <sup>10</sup>I have confidence toward you in the Lord,
that ye will be no otherwise minded; but he that troubles you shall
bear his judgment, whoever he may be. <sup>11</sup>But as for me,
brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still
persecuted? Then has the offense of the cross ceased.
<sup>12</sup>I would that they were even cut off who unsettle
you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>For ye were called unto liberty,
brethren; only use not the liberty for an occasion to the flesh,
but by love serve one another. <sup>14</sup>For all the law is
fulfilled in one word, in this: <span class="ot">Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <sup>15</sup>But if ye bite and
devour one another, beware lest ye be consumed by one another.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye
will not fulfill the desire of the flesh. <sup>17</sup>For the
flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, that ye may not
do those things that ye would. <sup>18</sup>But if ye are led by
the Spirit, ye are not under law.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Now the works of the flesh are
manifest; which are, fornication, uncleanness, wantonness,
<sup>20</sup>idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife, emulation, wraths,
contentions, divisions, factions, <sup>21</sup>envyings, murders,
drunkenness, revelings; and things like these; of which I tell you
beforehand, as I also said before, that they who do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
<sup>23</sup>meekness, temperance; against such things there is no
law. <sup>24</sup>And they that are Christ's crucified the flesh
with its passions and desires. <sup>25</sup>If we live by the
Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. <sup>26</sup>Let us not
become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one
another.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

fulfill<sup><a href="#r480602" id="f480602" title="see footnote"
name="f480602">2</a></sup> the law of Christ. <sup>3</sup>For if a
man thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives
himself. <sup>4</sup>But let each one prove his own work, and then
shall he have ground of glorying in reference to himself alone, and
not to another. <sup>5</sup>For each one shall bear his own
load.</p>
<p class="pis"><sup>6</sup>But let him that is taught in the word
share with him that teaches, in all good things. <sup>7</sup>Be not
deceived; God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that shall he
also reap. <sup>8</sup>Because he that sows to his flesh shall of
the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of
the Spirit reap life everlasting. <sup>9</sup>And let us not be
weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint
not. <sup>10</sup>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good
to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</p>

in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised; only that they
may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.

they may glory in your flesh. <sup>14</sup>But far be it from me to
glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the
world is crucified to me, and I to the world. <sup>15</sup>For in
Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor
uncircumcision, but a new creation. <sup>16</sup>And as many as
walk by this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel

according to the purpose of him who works all things after the

believed<sup><a href="#r490113" id="f490113" title="see footnote"

walked according to the course of this world, according to the
prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now working in
the sons of disobedience; <sup>3</sup>among whom we also all walked
in time past in the desires of our flesh, doing the will of the
flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even
as others;&mdash; <sup>4</sup>but God, being rich in mercy, on
account of his great love wherewith he loved us, made us,
<sup>5</sup>even when we were dead in sins, alive with Christ, (by
grace ye are saved,) <sup>6</sup>and raised us with him, and made
us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus;
<sup>7</sup>that he might show, in the ages to come, the exceeding
richness of his grace, in his kindness toward us in Christ
Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>For by grace ye are saved through faith;
and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; <sup>9</sup>not
of works, lest any one should boast. <sup>10</sup>For we are his
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
before prepared that we should walk in them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Wherefore remember, that in time past
ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by
that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by
hand,&mdash; <sup>12</sup>that at that time ye were without Christ,
being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from
the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God in
the world. <sup>13</sup>But now, in Christ Jesus, ye, who in time
past were afar off, were made near by the blood of Christ.
<sup>14</sup>For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down
the middle wall of partition; <sup>15</sup>having abolished in his
flesh the enmity, the law of commandments contained in ordinances,
that he might make the two one new man in himself, making peace;
<sup>16</sup>and might reconcile both to God in one body by the
cross, having slain the enmity thereby. <sup>17</sup>And he came
and brought the good news of peace to you who were afar off, and to
those who were near. <sup>18</sup>Because through him we both have
the access in one Spirit to the Father.</p>

sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the
household of God; <sup>20</sup>having been built upon the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being
the chief corner-stone; <sup>21</sup>in whom all the building,
fitly framed together, grows unto a holy temple in the Lord;

therefore, to walk worthy of the calling with which ye were called,
<sup>2</sup>with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering,
bearing with one another in love; <sup>3</sup>endeavoring to keep
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. <sup>4</sup>There is
one body, and one Spirit, as also ye were called in one hope of
your calling; <sup>5</sup>one Lord, one faith, one immersion,
<sup>6</sup>one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through
all, and in all. <sup>7</sup>But to each one of us the grace was
given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
<sup>8</sup>Wherefore he says:</p>
<p class="pp4">When he ascended on high,</p>
<p class="pp4">He led captivity captive,</p>
<p class="pp4">And gave gifts to men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Now this, <span class="ot">he
ascended,</span> what is it but that he also descended into the
lower parts of the earth? <sup>10</sup>The one who descended, he is
also the one who ascended above all the heavens, that he may fill
all things. <sup>11</sup>And he gave some as apostles, some as
prophets, some as evangelists, some as pastors and teachers;
<sup>12</sup>for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ;
<sup>13</sup>till we all attain to the unity of the faith and of
the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure
of the stature of the fullness of Christ; <sup>14</sup>that we may
no longer be children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with
every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, by cunning
craftiness after the wily manner of error; <sup>15</sup>but holding
the truth, may in love grow up into him in all things, who is the
head, Christ; <sup>16</sup>from whom all the body, fitly framed
together and compacted by means of every joint of the supply,
according to the working in the measure of each single part,
effects the increase of the body to the upbuilding of itself in
love.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>This therefore I say, and testify in
the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles
walk<sup><a href="#r490417" id="f490417" title="see footnote" name=
"f490417">17</a></sup>, in the vanity of their mind,
<sup>18</sup>having the understanding darkened, being alienated
from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in then,
because of the hardness of their heart; <sup>19</sup>who, as being
past feeling, gave themselves up to wantonness, to work all
uncleanness in greediness<sup><a href="#r490419" id="f490419"
title="see footnote" name="f490419">19</a></sup>. <sup>20</sup>But
ye did not so learn Christ, <sup>21</sup>if indeed ye heard him,
and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus; <sup>22</sup>that
ye put off, as concerns your former deportment, the old man who is
corrupted according to the lusts of deceit, <sup>23</sup>and be
renewed in the spirit of your mind, <sup>24</sup>and put on the new
man, who was created after God in the righteousness and holiness of
the truth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Wherefore, having put away falsehood,
speak truth each one with his neighbor; because we are members one
of another. <sup>26</sup><span class="ot">Be angry and sin

<sup>27</sup>neither give place to the Devil.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Let him that stole steal no more; but
rather let him labor, working with his hands that which is good,
that he may have to impart to him that has need. <sup>29</sup>Let
no corrupt discourse proceed out of your mouth, but whatever is
good for needful edification, that it may impart grace to the
hearers. <sup>30</sup>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in
whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption. <sup>31</sup>Let
all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil
speaking, be put away from you, with all malice; <sup>32</sup>and
be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as
also God in Christ forgave you.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class=

<sup>2</sup>and walk in love, as also Christ loved us, and gave
himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor
of sweet smell.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or
covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becomes
saints, <sup>4</sup>and filthiness, and foolish talking, and
jesting, which are not becoming, but rather giving of thanks.
<sup>5</sup>For this ye know, being aware that no fornicator, nor
unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has an
inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. <sup>6</sup>Let no
one deceive you with vain words; for because of these things comes
the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Become not therefore partakers with
them. <sup>8</sup>For ye were once darkness, but now light in the
Lord. Walk as children of light,&mdash; <sup>9</sup>for the fruit
of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,&mdash;
<sup>10</sup>proving what is acceptable to the Lord;
<sup>11</sup>and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
darkness, but rather also reprove them. <sup>12</sup>For it is a
shame even to speak of the things done by them in secret.
<sup>13</sup>But all things, when reproved, are by the light made
manifest; for whatever makes manifest is light.
<sup>14</sup>Wherefore he says: <span class="ot">Awake, thou that
sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ will give thee
light.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>See to it then, how ye walk with
exactness, not as unwise, but as wise, <sup>16</sup>redeeming the
time, because the days are evil. <sup>17</sup>Therefore be not
foolish, but understanding what is the will of the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is
excess, but be filled with the Spirit; <sup>19</sup>speaking to one
another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making
melody in your heart to the Lord; <sup>20</sup>giving thanks always
for all things, to God and the Father, in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ; <sup>21</sup>submitting yourselves to one another in
the fear of Christ; <sup>22</sup>wives to their own husbands, as to
the Lord. <sup>23</sup>Because a husband is the head of the wife,
as also Christ is the head of the church; himself the Savior of the
body. <sup>24</sup>But as the church is subjected to Christ, so
also are the wives to their own husbands in everything.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Husbands, love your wives, as also
Christ loved the church, and gave himself up for it;
<sup>26</sup>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the
bathing of water in the word, <sup>27</sup>that he might himself
present to himself the church, glorious, having no spot, or
wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it may be holy and blameless.
<sup>28</sup>So husbands ought to love their wives as their own
bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself. <sup>29</sup>For no
one ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, as
also Christ the church; <sup>30</sup>because we are members of his
body, [being] of his flesh, and of his bones.
<sup>31</sup><span class="ot">For this cause shall a man leave
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall
be one flesh.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>This mystery is great; but I am
speaking of Christ and of the church. <sup>33</sup>Nevertheless, do
ye also, severally, each so love his wife even as himself; and let
the wife see that she reverence her husband.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Servants, obey your masters according to

<sup>7</sup>with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not
to men; <sup>8</sup>knowing that whatever good thing each may have
done, that shall he receive from the Lord, whether bond or
free.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And masters, do the same things to them,
forbearing threatening; knowing that both their Master and yours is
in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in
the power of his might. <sup>11</sup>Put on the whole armor of God,
that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil.

the heavenly places<sup><a href="#r490612" id="f490612" title=

take on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in
the evil day, and having fully done all, to stand.
<sup>14</sup>Stand therefore, having girded your loins about with
truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness;
<sup>15</sup>and having shod your feet with the preparation of the
gospel of peace; <sup>16</sup>in addition to all, having taken on
the shield of faith, in which ye will be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked one. <sup>17</sup>And receive the helmet
of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
God; <sup>18</sup>praying at every fitting season in the Spirit,
with all prayer and supplication, and watching thereunto with all
perseverance and supplication for all the saints; <sup>19</sup>and
for me, that utterance may be given to me, in the opening of my
mouth with boldness, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>

the Lord, will make all known to you; <sup>22</sup>whom I sent to
you for this very thing, that ye might know our affairs, and that

<sup>23</sup>but am constrained by the two, having the desire to
depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better;
<sup>24</sup>but to remain in the flesh is more needful for your
sakes. <sup>25</sup>And being persuaded of this, I know that I
shall remain, and shall continue with you all for your furtherance
and joy in the faith; <sup>26</sup>that your glorying may be more
abundant in Jesus Christ for me, through my coming to you
again.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Only let your deportment be as becomes
the gospel of Christ; that whether I come and see you, or remain
absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one
spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the
gospel; <sup>28</sup>and in nothing terrified by the adversaries;
which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of
salvation<sup><a href="#r500128" id="f500128" title="see footnote"
name="f500128">28</a></sup>, and that from God.
<sup>29</sup>Because to you it was granted in behalf of
Christ,&mdash;not only to believe on him,&mdash;but in his behalf
to suffer also; <sup>30</sup>having the same conflict as ye saw in
me, and now hear of in me.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

is any consolation<sup><a href="#r500201" id="f500201" title=
"see footnote" name="f500201">1</a></sup> in Christ, if any comfort
from love, if any communion of the Spirit, if any tender affection
and compassion, <sup>2</sup>make my joy complete, that ye be of the
same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of the one
mind; <sup>3</sup>doing nothing through contentiousness or
vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each esteeming others better
than himself; <sup>4</sup>regarding not each one his own, but each
one also the things of others. <sup>5</sup>Let this mind be in you,
which was also in Christ Jesus; <sup>6</sup>who, being in the form
of God, did not account it robbery to be equal with God;
<sup>7</sup>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,
being made in the likeness of men. <sup>8</sup>And being found in
fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death,
even the death of the cross. <sup>9</sup>Wherefore also God highly
exalted him, and gave him a name which is above every name;
<sup>10</sup>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
beings in heaven, and of beings on earth, and of beings under the
earth, <sup>11</sup>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye always
obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my
absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
<sup>13</sup>for it is God who works in you both to will and to
perform, of his good pleasure.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Do all without murmurings and
disputings; <sup>15</sup>that ye may become blameless and simple,
children of God, unreproachable, in the midst of a crooked and
perverse generation, among whom ye appear as do the heavenly lights
in the world; <sup>16</sup>holding forth<sup><a href="#r500116" id=
"f500116" title="see footnote" name="f500116">16</a></sup> the word
of life; for a ground of glorying to me at the day of Christ, that
I did not run in vain, or labor in vain.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>But even if I am poured out on the
sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice
with you all. <sup>18</sup>For the same cause<sup><a href=
"#r500218" id="f500218" title="see footnote" name=
"f500218">18</a></sup>, do ye also rejoice, and rejoice with
me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send
Timothy shortly to you, that I also may be cheered, when I know
your state. <sup>20</sup>For I have no one like-minded, who will
sincerely care for your state. <sup>21</sup>For all seek their own,
not the things of Jesus Christ. <sup>22</sup>But ye know the proof
of him, that, as a child with a father, he served with me for the
gospel. <sup>23</sup>Him therefore I hope to send without delay, so
soon as I shall see how it will go with me; <sup>24</sup>but I
trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
<sup>25</sup>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you
Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and
fellow-soldier, but your messenger and minister to my wants.
<sup>26</sup>For he was longing after you all, and was much
distressed, because ye heard that he was sick. <sup>27</sup>For
indeed he was sick near to death; but God had mercy on him, and not
on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon
sorrow. <sup>28</sup>I sent him therefore with the more haste, that
seeing him again ye might rejoice, and that I may be less
sorrowful. <sup>29</sup>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all
gladness, and hold such in honor; <sup>30</sup>because for the work
of Christ he came near to death, hazarding his life, that he might
supply what things were lacking on your part, of the ministration
to me.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class="sc">inally</span>, my
brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to
me is not burdensome, and for you it is safe.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil
workers, beware of the concision. <sup>3</sup>For we are the
circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ
Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. <sup>4</sup>Though I
have confidence also in the flesh. If any other thinks that he has
confidence in the flesh, I more; <sup>5</sup>circumcised the eighth
day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of
Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; <sup>6</sup>as to zeal,
persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the
law, blameless.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>But what things were gain to me, these I
have accounted loss for Christ. <sup>8</sup>Nay more, and I account
all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
Jesus my Lord; for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and
account them refuse, that I may gain Christ, <sup>9</sup>and be
found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of law, but
that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is
of God, upon faith; <sup>10</sup>that I may know him, and the power
of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his
sufferings<sup><a href="#r500310" id="f500310" title="see footnote"
name="f500310">10</a></sup>, being conformed to his death;
<sup>11</sup>if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from
the dead.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Not that I already obtained [the
prize]<sup><a href="#r500312" id="f500312" title="see footnote"
name="f500312">12</a></sup>, or have already been perfected; but I
pursue onward, if I may lay hold of that for which I was laid hold
of by Christ Jesus. <sup>13</sup>Brethren, I do not count myself to
have laid hold of it; but one thing I do, forgetting the things
behind, and reaching forth to the things before, <sup>14</sup>I
pursue on toward the mark, for the prize of the heavenly calling of
God in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Let us therefore, as many as are
perfect, be of this mind; and if in any thing ye are otherwise
minded, this also God will reveal to you.
<sup>16</sup>Nevertheless, whereto we have attained, in the same
let us walk.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Brethren, be followers together of me,
and mark those who so walk, as ye have us for an example.
<sup>18</sup>For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell
you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ;
<sup>19</sup>whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly,
and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
<sup>20</sup>For our citizenship<sup><a href="#r500320" id=
"f500320" title="see footnote" name="f500320">20</a></sup> is in
heaven; from whence we also look for a Savior, the Lord Jesus
Christ; <sup>21</sup>who will transform the body of our
humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory,
according to the working with which he is able also to subject all
things to himself.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>1</sup>Therefore, my brethren beloved and
longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord,
beloved.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>I beseech Euodia, and I beseech
Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord. <sup>3</sup>Yea, I
entreat thee also, true yoke-fellow, help these women, who labored
with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my
fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will
say, rejoice. <sup>5</sup>Let your forbearance be known to all men.
The Lord is at hand. <sup>6</sup>Be anxious for nothing; but in
every thing, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your
requests be made known to God. <sup>7</sup>And the peace of God,
which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your
minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Finally, brethren, whatever things are
true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just,
whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever
things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be
any praise, think on these things. <sup>9</sup>The things also,
which ye learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, these do;
and the God of peace will be with you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly,
that now at length ye revived again in your care for my welfare;
for which ye were also careful, but lacked opportunity.
<sup>11</sup>Not that I speak in respect of want; for I learned, in
whatever state I am, to be content. <sup>12</sup>I both know how to
be abased, and I know how to abound; in every thing, and in all
things, I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to
abound and to be in want. <sup>13</sup>I can do all things, in him
who strengthens me.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Notwithstanding, ye did well to share
with me in my affliction. <sup>15</sup>And ye also know,
Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went forth
from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in an account of
giving and receiving<sup><a href="#r500415" id="f500415" title=
"see footnote" name="f500415">15</a></sup>, but ye only;
<sup>16</sup>that also in Thessalonica, ye sent once and again to
my necessity. <sup>17</sup>Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek
for the fruit that abounds to your account.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>But I have all, and abound; I am full,
having received of Epaphroditus the things sent from you, an odor
of sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.
<sup>19</sup>But my God will supply all your need, according to his
riches in glory, in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Now to God and our Father be the glory
forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The
brethren who are with me salute you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>All the saints salute you, but
especially they that are of C&aelig;sar's household.</p>

Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>We give thanks to God the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, <sup>4</sup>having heard
of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have toward
all the saints, <sup>5</sup>because of the hope which is laid up
for you in heaven, of which ye heard before in the word of the
truth of the gospel; <sup>6</sup>which is come to you, as also in
all the world, and is bringing forth fruit and increasing also in
you, since the day ye heard it, and knew the grace of God in truth;
<sup>7</sup>as ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant,
who is for you a faithful minister of Christ, <sup>8</sup>who also
made known to us your love in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>For this cause we also, since the day we
heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that ye may be
filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding; <sup>10</sup>that ye may walk worthy of the Lord
unto all pleasing, bringing forth fruit in every good work, and
increasing in the knowledge of God; <sup>11</sup>being strengthened
with all strength, according to his glorious power, unto all
patience and long-suffering with joy; <sup>12</sup>giving thanks to
the Father, who made us meet for the portion of the inheritance of
the saints in light; <sup>13</sup>who delivered us out of the power
of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his
love; <sup>14</sup>in whom we have the redemption, the remission of
our sins; <sup>15</sup>who is the image of the invisible God, the
first-born of every creature, <sup>16</sup>because in him were all
things created, the things in the heavens, and the things on the
earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or
dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things have been
created by him, and for him; <sup>17</sup>and he is before all
things, and in him all things subsist. <sup>18</sup>And he is the
head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the first-born
from the dead; that he may become in all things pre-eminent.
<sup>19</sup>For He was pleased, that in him should all the
fullness dwell; <sup>20</sup>and through him to reconcile all
things to himself, having made peace through the blood of his
cross; through him, whether the things on the earth, or the things
in the heavens.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And you also, being in time past
alienated, and enemies in your mind in wicked works, yet now has he
reconciled <sup>22</sup>in the body of his flesh through death, to
present you holy and blameless and unaccused before him;
<sup>23</sup>if indeed ye continue in the faith grounded and
settled, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye
heard, which was preached in the whole creation which is under
heaven; of which I Paul was made a minister.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you,
and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my
flesh for his body, which is the church; <sup>25</sup>of which I
was made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which was
given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God, <sup>26</sup>the
mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but
now has been manifested to his saints; <sup>27</sup>to whom God
willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this
mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory; <sup>28</sup>whom we announce, warning every man, and

perfect in Christ; <sup>29</sup>to which end I also labor, striving

the understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God,
even Christ; <sup>3</sup>in whom are all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge hidden.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And this I say, that no one may beguile
you with enticing words. <sup>5</sup>For though I am absent in the

circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of
the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ; <sup>12</sup>being buried
with him in the immersion, wherein ye were also raised with him
through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
<sup>13</sup>And you also, being dead in your trespasses and the
uncircumcision of your flesh, he made alive together with him,
graciously forgiving us all our trespasses; <sup>14</sup>blotting
out the handwriting in ordinances that was against us, which was
opposed to us, and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to

you of the prize, seeking it<sup><a href="#r510218" id="f510218"

worship of the angels, intruding into things which he has not seen,
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, <sup>19</sup>and not holding
fast the head, from whom all the body, by means of the joints and
bands having nourishment ministered, and being knit together,
increases with the increase of God.</p>

rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye
subject to ordinances, <sup>21</sup>"Handle not, nor taste, nor

after the commandments and teachings of men? <sup>23</sup>Which
things have indeed a show of wisdom in self-chosen worship, and
humiliation, and neglecting of the body, not in any honor, for the
satisfying of the flesh.</p>

<sup>4</sup>When Christ, our life, shall be manifested, then will
ye also with him be manifested in glory.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Mortify therefore your members which are
upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and
covetousness, which is idolatry; <sup>6</sup>on account of which
things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience;

things. <sup>8</sup>But now, do ye also put all away, anger, wrath,
malice, reviling, filthy communication out of your mouth.
<sup>9</sup>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the
old man with his deeds, <sup>10</sup>and have put on the new man,
who is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him who
created him; <sup>11</sup>where there is no Greek and Jew,
circumcision and uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bondman,

hearts, to which ye were also called in one body; and be
thankful.</p>

the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through
him.</p>

not to men; <sup>24</sup>knowing that from the Lord ye will receive
the recompense of the inheritance. Serve the Lord Christ.

wrongfully; and there is no respect of persons.</p>

also for us, that God would open to us a door for the word, to
speak the mystery of Christ, for the sake of which I am also in
bonds, <sup>4</sup>that I may make it manifest, as I ought to

without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience
of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before God and our Father;
<sup>4</sup>knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election;
<sup>5</sup>because our gospel came not to you in word only, but
also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as ye
know what manner of men were we among you, for your sake.
<sup>6</sup>And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having
received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;
<sup>7</sup>so that ye became an example to all that believe in
Macedonia and Achaia. <sup>8</sup>For from you has sounded forth
the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in
every place your faith toward God has gone forth; so that we have
no need to speak anything. <sup>9</sup>For they themselves report

<sup>2</sup>But having before suffered, and been shamefully
treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak
to you the gospel of God in much conflict. <sup>3</sup>For our
exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile;
<sup>4</sup>but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted
with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who
proves our hearts. <sup>5</sup>For neither at any time used we
flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is
witness; <sup>6</sup>nor of men sought we glory, neither from you,
nor from others, though able to use authority, as Christ's
apostles. <sup>7</sup>But we were gentle among you, as a nurse
cherishes her children; <sup>8</sup>so, being affectionately
desirous of you, we were willing to impart to you, not only the
gospel of God, but also our own souls, because ye were dear to us.
<sup>9</sup>For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil; night
and day working, in order not to burden any of you, we preached to
you the gospel of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Ye are witnesses, and God, how holily
and justly and unblamably we behaved ourselves to you that believe;
<sup>11</sup>as ye know how we exhorted, and encouraged, and
charged every one of you, as a father his children,
<sup>12</sup>that ye should walk worthy of God, who is calling you
into his kingdom and glory.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>For this cause we also thank God
without ceasing, that when ye received the word of God heard from
us, ye received not the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the
word of God, which also works in you that believe. <sup>14</sup>For
ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which are in
Jud&aelig;a in Christ Jesus; for ye also suffered the same things
of your own countrymen, as they have of the Jews; <sup>15</sup>who
both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us forth,
and please not God, and are contrary to all men;
<sup>16</sup>hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they
might be saved, to fill up their sins always; and the wrath came
upon them to the utmost.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>But we, brethren, having been severed
from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, endeavored
the more abundantly to see your face, with great desire.
<sup>18</sup>Wherefore we would fain have come to you, even I,
Paul, once and again; and Satan hindered us. <sup>19</sup>For what
is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not also ye, in the
presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? <sup>20</sup>For
ye are our glory and joy.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">herefore</span>,
when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left
behind at Athens alone; <sup>2</sup>and sent Timothy, our brother,
and a fellow-worker with God in the gospel of Christ, to establish
you, and to exhort you concerning your faith; <sup>3</sup>that no
one should be shaken by these afflictions, for yourselves know that
unto this we are appointed. <sup>4</sup>For even when we were with
you, we told you before that we are to suffer affliction; as also
it came to pass, and ye know. <sup>5</sup>For this cause, when I
too could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by
some means the tempter tempted you, and our labor should be in
vain.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>But now, when Timothy came to us from
you, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love, and that
ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us,
as we also to see you; <sup>7</sup>for this cause we were consoled,
brethren, over you in all our affliction and distress, through your
faith; <sup>8</sup>because now we live, if ye stand fast in the
Lord. <sup>9</sup>For what thanks can we render to God for you, for
all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before our God;
<sup>10</sup>night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your
face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Now God and our Father himself, and our
Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you. <sup>12</sup>And the Lord
make you increase and abound in love toward one another, and toward
all, as we also do toward you; <sup>13</sup>to the end he may
establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God and our
Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his
saints.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class="sc">urthermore</span>
then, brethren, we beseech you, and exhort you in the Lord Jesus,
that as ye received from us how ye ought to walk and to please God,
as also ye are walking, ye would abound yet more. <sup>2</sup>For
ye know what commands we gave you, through the Lord Jesus.
<sup>3</sup>For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that
ye abstain from fornication; <sup>4</sup>that each one of you know
how to possess<sup><a href="#r520404" id="f520404" title=
"see footnote" name="f520404">4</a></sup> his vessel in
sanctification and honor; <sup>5</sup>not in lustful passion, as
also the Gentiles who know not God. <sup>6</sup>That no one go
beyond and defraud his brother in any matter<sup><a href="#r520406"
id="f520406" title="see footnote" name="f520406">6</a></sup>;
because the Lord is the avenger for all these things, as we also
told you before, and testified. <sup>7</sup>For God did not call us
to uncleanness, but in sanctification. <sup>8</sup>Therefore he
that rejects, rejects not man, but God, who also gave to you his
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>But concerning brotherly love ye need
not that I write to you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to
love one another. <sup>10</sup>For indeed ye do it, toward all the
brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we beseech you, brethren, to
abound yet more; <sup>11</sup>and to study to be quiet, and to do
your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded
you; <sup>12</sup>that ye may walk becomingly toward those without,
and may have need of nothing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>But we desire that you should not be
ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are sleeping, that ye
sorrow not, as others who have no hope. <sup>14</sup>For if we
believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also those who fell
asleep through Jesus will God bring with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>For this we say to you, in the word of
the Lord, that we the living, who remain unto the coming of the
Lord, shall not precede those who fell asleep. <sup>16</sup>Because
the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the
voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in
Christ will first rise. <sup>17</sup>Then we the living, who
remain, will be caught up together with them in clouds, to meet the
Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Wherefore, encourage one another with
these words.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class=
"sc">ut</span> of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no
need that I write to you. <sup>2</sup>For yourselves know perfectly
that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.
<sup>3</sup>For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden
destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child;
and they shall not escape.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness,
that the day should overtake you as a thief. <sup>5</sup>For all ye
are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of
darkness. <sup>6</sup>So then let us not sleep, as others; but let
us watch and be sober. <sup>7</sup>For they that sleep, sleep in
the night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the night.
<sup>8</sup>But let us, being of the day, be sober, putting on the
breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of
salvation; <sup>9</sup>because God did not appoint us to wrath, but
to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ; <sup>10</sup>who
died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live
together with him. <sup>11</sup>Wherefore encourage each other, and
edify one the other, as also ye do.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And we beseech you, brethren, to know
those who labor among you, and preside over you in the Lord, and
admonish you; <sup>13</sup>and to esteem them very highly in love
for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Now we exhort you, brethren, admonish
the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be
long-suffering toward all. <sup>15</sup>See that none render evil
for evil to any one but ever follow that which is good, both toward
one another, and toward all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Rejoice always. <sup>17</sup>Pray
without ceasing. <sup>18</sup>In everything give thanks; for this
is the will of God in Christ Jesus, toward you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Quench not the Spirit.
<sup>20</sup>Despise not prophesyings; <sup>21</sup>but prove all
things, hold fast that which is good. <sup>22</sup>Abstain from
every form of evil. <sup>23</sup>And the God of peace himself
sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be
preserved whole without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ. <sup>24</sup>Faithful is he who calls you, who also will do
it.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Brethren, pray for us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>Salute all the brethren with a holy
kiss.</p>

<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>We are bound to thank God always for
you, brethren, as it is meet, because your faith grows exceedingly,
and the love of each one of you all toward one another abounds;
<sup>4</sup>so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of
God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and the
afflictions which ye endure; <sup>5</sup>a token of the righteous
judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of
God, for which ye also suffer; <sup>6</sup>since it is a righteous
thing with God to recompense affliction to those who afflict you,
<sup>7</sup>and to you who are afflicted rest with us, at the
revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his
power, <sup>8</sup>in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who
know not God, and those who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ; <sup>9</sup>who shall suffer justice, eternal destruction,
from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power;
<sup>10</sup>when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and
to be admired in all who believed (because our testimony to you was
believed), in that day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>To which end we also pray for you
always, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and
accomplish all the good pleasure of goodness and the work of faith,
with power; <sup>12</sup>that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may

God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

<sup>3</sup>Let not any one deceive you in any manner; because
[that day will not come], except there come first the falling away,
and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
<sup>4</sup>he that opposes and exalts himself against all that is
called God, or that is worshiped; so that he sits in the temple of
God, showing himself that he is God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Remember ye not, that, when I was yet
with you, I told you these things? <sup>6</sup>And now ye know what
withholds, in order that he may be revealed in his own time.
<sup>7</sup>For the mystery of iniquity is already working; only
until he who now withholds shall be out of the way. <sup>8</sup>And
then will the Lawless One be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will
consume with the breath of his mouth, and will destroy with the
manifestation of his coming; <sup>9</sup>[him,] whose coming is
after the working of Satan, in all power and signs and lying
wonders, <sup>10</sup>and in all deceit of unrighteousness for
those who perish; because they received not the love of the truth,
that they might be saved. <sup>11</sup>And for this cause God sends
them a working of delusion, in order that they may believe the lie;
<sup>12</sup>that they may all be judged, who believed not the
truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>But we are bound to give thanks to God
always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God from the
beginning chose you to salvation, in sanctification of the Spirit
and belief of the truth; <sup>14</sup>whereunto he called you by
our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<sup>15</sup>So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the
traditions<sup><a href="#r530215" id="f530215" title="see footnote"
name="f530215">15</a></sup> which ye were taught, whether by word,
or by our letter.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and
God and our Father, who loved us, and gave us everlasting
consolation and good hope through grace, <sup>17</sup>encourage
your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.</p>

brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be
glorified, as also with you; <sup>2</sup>and that we may be

do, the things which we command you. <sup>5</sup>And the Lord
direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of
Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Now we command you, brethren, in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from
every brother walking disorderly, and not after the
tradition<sup><a href="#r530306" id="f530306" title="see footnote"
name="f530306">6</a></sup> which they received from us.
<sup>7</sup>For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us; that we
were not disorderly among you, <sup>8</sup>nor did we eat bread of
any one for naught, but with labor and toil, working night and day
that we might not be burdensome to any of you; <sup>9</sup>not
because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example to you,
that ye should follow us. <sup>10</sup>For also when we were with
you, this we commanded you: If any will not work, neither let him
eat. <sup>11</sup>For we hear of some who walk among you
disorderly, working not at all, but are busy-bodies.
<sup>12</sup>Now such we command, and exhort, in the Lord Jesus
Christ, that with quietness working, they eat their own bread.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>But ye, brethren, be not weary in well
doing. <sup>14</sup>And if any one obeys not our word by this
letter, mark that man, and keep not company with him, that he may
be shamed. <sup>15</sup>And count him not as an enemy, but admonish
him as a brother.</p>

TIMOTHY.</a></h1>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;P<span class=

commandment of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope,
<sup>2</sup>to Timothy, a true child in the faith: Grace, mercy,
peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>As I besought thee to remain still in
Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge
certain ones not to teach other doctrine, <sup>4</sup>nor to give
heed to fables and endless genealogies, which further disputes
rather than God's dispensation, which is in faith, [so do.]</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Now the end of the commandment is love,
out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned;
<sup>6</sup>from which some swerving turned aside to idle
prattling; <sup>7</sup>desiring to be teachers of the law,
understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
<sup>8</sup>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it
lawfully; <sup>9</sup>knowing this, that the law is not made for a
righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and
sinful, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
murderers of mothers<sup><a href="#r540109" id="f540109" title=
"see footnote" name="f540109">9</a></sup>; for man-slayers,
<sup>10</sup>for fornicators, for those who defile themselves with
mankind, for enslavers of men, for liars, for false swearers, and
whatever else is contrary to the sound teachings;
<sup>11</sup>according to the glorious gospel of the blissful God,
with which I was entrusted.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And I thank him who gave me strength,
Christ Jesus our Lord, that he accounted me faithful, putting me
into the ministry, <sup>13</sup>who was formerly a blasphemer, and
a persecutor, and overbearing. But I obtained mercy, because I did
it ignorantly, in unbelief; <sup>14</sup>and the grace of our Lord
abounded exceedingly, with faith and love which is in Christ
Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of
all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners; of whom I am chief. <sup>16</sup>But for this cause I
obtained mercy, that in me first<sup><a href="#r540116a" id=

Christ Jesus might show forth all his long-suffering<sup><a href=

hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Now to the King eternal, the
imperishable, invisible, only God, be honor and glory forever and
ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>This charge I commit to thee, my child
Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before concerning
thee, that thou mayest wage in them the good warfare;
<sup>19</sup>having faith, and a good conscience, which some
thrusting away made shipwreck concerning the faith. <sup>20</sup>Of
whom is Hymen&aelig;us and Alexander; whom I delivered over to
Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I
<span class="sc">exhort</span> then, first of all, that
supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for
all men; <sup>2</sup>for kings, and all that are in authority; that
we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and decorum.
<sup>3</sup>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of our
Savior God; <sup>4</sup>who desires that all should be saved, and
come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>For there is one God, one mediator also
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; <sup>6</sup>who gave
himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time;
<sup>7</sup>whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle (I
speak truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
truth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>I desire, therefore, that the men pray
in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing;
<sup>9</sup>in like manner also that women, in becoming apparel,
adorn themselves with modesty and sobriety; not in braided hair, or
gold, or pearls, or costly raiment; <sup>10</sup>but, which becomes
women professing godliness, by means of good works.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Let the woman learn in silence, with
all subjection. <sup>12</sup>But I permit not the woman to teach,
nor to have authority over the man, but to be in silence.
<sup>13</sup>For Adam was first formed, then Eve. <sup>14</sup>And
Adam was not deceived; but the woman, being deceived, has fallen
into transgression. <sup>15</sup>But she shall be saved through
child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness,
with sobriety.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

overseer then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober,
discreet, orderly, hospitable, apt in teaching; <sup>3</sup>not
given to wine, not a striker, but forbearing, averse to strife, not
a lover of money; <sup>4</sup>presiding well over his own house,
having his children in subjection with all decorum;
<sup>5</sup>(but if one knows not how to preside over his own
house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
<sup>6</sup>not a novice<sup><a href="#r540306" id="f540306" title=

with pride he fall into the condemnation of the Devil.
<sup>7</sup>But he must also have a good testimony from those
without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Deacons in like manner must be grave,
not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of gain;
<sup>9</sup>holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
<sup>10</sup>And let these also first be proved; then let them
serve as deacons, being without reproach. <sup>11</sup>[Their]
wives in like manner must be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful
in all things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Let the deacons be husbands of one
wife, presiding well over their children and their own houses.
<sup>13</sup>For they that have served well as deacons obtain for
themselves a good degree<sup><a href="#r540313" id="f540313" title=

the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>These things I write to thee, hoping to
come to thee shortly; <sup>15</sup>but if I tarry long, that thou
mayest know how thou oughtest to conduct thyself in the house of
God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground
of the truth. <sup>16</sup>And confessedly, great is the mystery of
godliness; God was manifested<sup><a href="#r540316" id="f540316"
title="see footnote" name="f540316">16</a></sup> in the flesh, was
justified in the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the

glory.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

says expressly, that in after-times some will depart from the
faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and teachings of demons;

conscience seared with a hot iron; <sup>3</sup>forbidding to marry,
commanding to abstain from food, which God created to be received
with thanksgiving, for those<sup><a href="#r540403" id="f540403"
title="see footnote" name="f540403">3</a></sup> who believe and
know the truth. <sup>4</sup>For every creature of God is good, and
nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving;
<sup>5</sup>for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>If thou put the brethren in mind of
these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus,

thou hast strictly followed. <sup>7</sup>But the profane and silly
fables<sup><a href="#r540407" id="f540407" title="see footnote"
name="f540407">7</a></sup> avoid, and exercise thyself unto
godliness. <sup>8</sup>For bodily exercise is profitable for
little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise
of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
<sup>9</sup>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance.
<sup>10</sup>For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach,
because we have hoped in the living God, who is the Savior of all
men, especially of believers.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>These things command and teach.
<sup>12</sup>Let no one despise thy youth; but become an example of
the believers, in word, in deportment, in love, in faith, in
purity. <sup>13</sup>Till I come, give attention to reading, to
exhortation, to teaching. <sup>14</sup>Neglect not the gift that is
in thee, which was given thee through prophecy, with the laying on
of the hands of the eldership. <sup>15</sup>Meditate on these
things<sup><a href="#r540415" id="f540415" title="see footnote"
name="f540415">15</a></sup>; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
progress may be manifest to all. <sup>16</sup>Give heed to thyself,

younger men as brethren; <sup>2</sup>elder women as mothers, the
younger as sisters, with all purity. <sup>3</sup>Honor as widows
those who are widows indeed. <sup>4</sup>But if any widow has
children or grand-children, let these learn first to show piety to
their own household, and to requite their parents, for this is
acceptable before God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Now she that is a widow indeed, and left
alone, has set her hope on God, and continues in supplications and
prayers, night and day. <sup>6</sup>But she that lives in pleasure
is dead while she lives. <sup>7</sup>And these things command, that
they may be blameless. <sup>8</sup>But if any one provides not for
his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied
the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Let not one be enrolled as a widow under
threescore years old, having been the wife of one husband;
<sup>10</sup>well reported of for good works; if she brought up
children, if she lodged strangers, if she washed the feet of the
saints, if she relieved the afflicted, if she diligently followed
every good work.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>But younger widows refuse; for when
they have become wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;
<sup>12</sup>having condemnation, because they broke their first
faith. <sup>13</sup>And at the same time they also learn to be
idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but
tattlers also and busy-bodies, speaking things which they ought
not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>I desire therefore that younger widows
marry, bear children, guide the house, give no occasion to the
adversary to speak reproachfully. <sup>15</sup>For already, some
turned aside after Satan.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>If any believing man or woman has
widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be burdened;
that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Let elders who preside well be counted
worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and
teaching. <sup>18</sup>For the Scripture says: <span class=
"ot">Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while treading out the
grain;</span> and, <span class="ot">The laborer is worthy of his
hire.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Against an elder receive not an
accusation, except before two or three witnesses<sup><a href=

<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Those who sin rebuke before all, that
the rest also may fear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>I charge thee before God, and Christ
Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without
prejudging, doing nothing with partiality.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>Lay hands hastily on no one, neither
share in other men's sins. Keep thyself pure.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>No longer drink water only, but use a
little wine for thy stomach's sake, and for thy frequent
infirmities.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>The sins of some men are openly
manifest, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.
<sup>25</sup>In like manner also the good works are openly
manifest; and those that are otherwise can not be hidden.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;L<span class="sc">et</span> as many as
are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all
honor, that the name of God and the teaching be not blasphemed.
<sup>2</sup>And they that have believing masters, let them not
despise them because they are brethren; but the rather do them
service, because they who receive the benefit are faithful and
beloved. These things teach and exhort.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>If any one teaches otherwise, and
assents not to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
to the teaching which is according to godliness, <sup>4</sup>he is
puffed up with pride, knowing nothing, but doting about questions
and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil
surmisings, <sup>5</sup>vain disputings of men corrupted in mind,
and robbed of the truth, supposing that godliness is a means of
gain. <sup>6</sup>But godliness with contentment is a great means
of gain. <sup>7</sup>For we brought nothing into the world; it is
certain we can also carry nothing out; <sup>8</sup>and having food
and raiment, let us be therewith content. <sup>9</sup>But they who
desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many
foolish and hurtful lusts, which sink men into destruction and
perdition. <sup>10</sup>For the love of money is a root of all
evils; which some coveting after wandered away from the faith, and
pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>But thou, O man of God, flee these
things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
patience, meekness of spirit. <sup>12</sup>Fight the good fight of
the faith, lay hold on the eternal life, unto which thou wast
called, and didst make the good profession before many
witnesses.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>I charge thee in the sight of God, who
preserves all alive, and of Jesus Christ, who before Pontius Pilate
witnessed the good profession, <sup>14</sup>that thou keep the
commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our
Lord Jesus Christ; <sup>15</sup>which in his own times<sup><a href=
"#r540615" id="f540615" title="see footnote" name=

Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; <sup>16</sup>who
only has immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man
has seen, or can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting.
Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Charge those who are rich in this
world, that they be not high-minded, nor place their hope on the
uncertainty of riches, but in God, who gives us all things richly
for enjoyment; <sup>18</sup>that they do good, be rich in good
works, be free in imparting, willing to communicate;
<sup>19</sup>laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true
life.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>O Timothy, keep that which is committed
to thy trust, avoiding the profane babblings, and oppositions of
that which is falsely called knowledge; <sup>21</sup>which some
professing erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee.</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;P<span class=

according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
<sup>2</sup>to Timothy, a beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from
God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>I thank God, whom I serve from my
forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have
remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
<sup>4</sup>longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may
be filled with joy; <sup>5</sup>calling to remembrance the
unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy
grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that it
dwells in thee also. <sup>6</sup>For which cause I put thee in
remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by
the laying on of my hands. <sup>7</sup>For God did not give us a
spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of chastisement.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Be not then ashamed of the testimony of
our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship with me for
the gospel, according to the power of God; <sup>9</sup>who saved
us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works,
but according to his own purpose, and the grace which was given us
in Christ Jesus before eternal ages, <sup>10</sup>but now made
manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ; who abolished
death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the
gospel; <sup>11</sup>for which I was appointed a preacher, and an
apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. <sup>12</sup>For which
cause I suffer also these things. But I am not ashamed; for I know
whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that
which I have committed to him, unto that day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Hold fast the form of sound words,
which thou heardest from me, in faith and love which is in Christ
Jesus. <sup>14</sup>The good thing committed to thee keep, through
the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Thou knowest this, that all those in
Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
<sup>16</sup>The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus;
because he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
<sup>17</sup>but when he was in Rome, he sought me out very
diligently, and found me. <sup>18</sup>The Lord grant to him, that
he may find mercy of the Lord in that day! And in how many things
he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">hou</span> therefore,
my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
<sup>2</sup>And the things that thou heardest from me by many
witnesses<sup><a href="#r550202" id="f550202" title="see footnote"
name="f550202">2</a></sup>, the same commit thou to faithful men,
who will be able to teach others also. <sup>3</sup>Endure hardship
with me, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. <sup>4</sup>No one
serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life,
that he may please him who chose him to be a soldier.
<sup>5</sup>And if a man also contends in the games, he is not
crowned, unless he contends lawfully. <sup>6</sup>The husbandman
that labors must first partake of the fruits. <sup>7</sup>Consider
what I say; for the Lord will give thee understanding in all
things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the
dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel; <sup>9</sup>in
which I endure hardship, even unto bonds, as an evil-doer; but the
word of God is not bound. <sup>10</sup>For this cause, I endure all
things for the sake of the chosen, that they also may obtain the
salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
<sup>11</sup>Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we
shall also live with him; <sup>12</sup>if we endure, we shall also
reign with him; if we shall deny him, he also will deny us;
<sup>13</sup>if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he can
not deny himself.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Of these things put them in
remembrance, charging them before the Lord not to strive about
words to no profit, to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Endeavor to present thyself approved to
God, a workman not made ashamed, rightly dividing<sup><a href=
"#r550215" id="f550215" title="see footnote" name=
"f550215">15</a></sup> the word of truth. <sup>16</sup>But shun the
profane babblings; for they will go on to more ungodliness.
<sup>17</sup>And their word will eat as does a canker; of whom is
Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus; <sup>18</sup>who erred concerning the
truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and
overturn the faith of some.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Nevertheless, God's firm foundation
stands, having this seal: <span class="ot">The Lord knew those who
are his;</span> and, <span class="ot">Let every one that names the
name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</span> <sup>20</sup>But in a
great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but
also of wood and of earth; and some for honor and some for
dishonor. <sup>21</sup>If a man therefore cleanse himself from
these, he shall be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful for the
master, prepared for every good work.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>But flee youthful lusts; and follow
righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord
out of a pure heart. <sup>23</sup>But the foolish and ignorant
questionings avoid, knowing that they beget strifes.
<sup>24</sup>And a servant of the Lord must not strive, but be
gentle toward all, apt in teaching, patient of evil;
<sup>25</sup>in meekness admonishing those who oppose themselves;
if haply God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of
the truth; <sup>26</sup>and that they may awake to soberness out of
the snare of the Devil, being taken captive by him, to do his
will<sup><a href="#r550226" id="f550226" title="see footnote" name=

<p class="pch"><span class=

that in the last days perilous times will come. <sup>2</sup>For men
will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
<sup>3</sup>without natural affection, implacable, false accusers,
incontinent, fierce, without love to the good,
<sup>4</sup>betrayers, headlong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure
rather than lovers of God; <sup>5</sup>having a form of godliness,
but denying the power thereof; and from these turn away.
<sup>6</sup>For of these are they who creep into houses, and lead
captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
<sup>7</sup>ever learning, and never able to come to the full
knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood
Moses, so also do these withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind,
reprobate concerning the faith. <sup>9</sup>But they shall proceed
no further; for their folly shall be fully manifest to all, as was
also theirs.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>But thou didst strictly follow my
teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love,
patience, <sup>11</sup>persecutions, afflictions; what things came
upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I
endured, and out of all the Lord delivered me. <sup>12</sup>Yea,
and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer
persecution. <sup>13</sup>But evil men and seducers will grow worse
and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. <sup>14</sup>But do thou
continue in the things which thou learnedst and wast assured of,
knowing of whom thou didst learn; <sup>15</sup>and that from a
child thou didst know the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make
thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ
Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>All Scripture is inspired by God, and
is profitable<sup><a href="#r550316" id="f550316" title=

reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;

who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and
his kingdom, <sup>2</sup>preach the word; apply thyself in season,
out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and
teaching. <sup>3</sup>For the time will come when they will not
endure the sound teaching, but according to their own desires will
to themselves heap up teachers, having itching ears;
<sup>4</sup>and they will turn away their ears from the truth, and
will turn aside to fables.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>But be thou watchful in all things,

his appearing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Endeavor to come to me shortly.

Dalmatia. <sup>11</sup>Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring

<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>At my first answer no one came forward
with me, but all forsook me. May it not be laid to their charge!

through me the preaching might be fully accomplished, and all the
Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the
lion. <sup>18</sup>The Lord will deliver me from every evil work,
and will bring me safe to his heavenly kingdom; to whom be the

<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>For this cause I left thee behind in
Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are

exhort, and to refute the gainsayers. <sup>10</sup>For there are
many unruly vain talkers and deceivers, chiefly they of the
circumcision; <sup>11</sup>whose mouths must be stopped, who
overturn whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for
the sake of base gain. <sup>12</sup>One of themselves, a prophet of
their own, said: Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy
gluttons. <sup>13</sup>This testimony is true. For which cause
reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;

<p class="pp1">Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>

sent forth for ministration, for the sake of those who are to
inherit salvation?</p>

account, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
heard, lest haply we should let them slip<sup><a href="#r580201"
id="f580201" title="see footnote" name="f580201">1</a></sup>.
<sup>2</sup>For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast,
and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution,
<sup>3</sup>how shall we escape, having neglected so great a
salvation; which began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
to us by those who heard, <sup>4</sup>God also bearing witness,
with signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of
the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>For not to the angels did he put in
subjection the world to come, of which we are speaking.
<sup>6</sup>But one in a certain place testified, saying:</p>
<p class="pp1">What is man, that thou art mindful of him,</p>
<p class="pp1">Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>7</sup>Thou madest him a little lower than the
angels;</p>
<p class="pp1">Thou crownedst him with glory and honor;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>8</sup>Thou didst put all things in subjection
under his feet.</p>
<p class="pin">For in that he put all in subjection under him, he
left nothing that is not put under him.</p>
<p class="pin">But now we do not yet see all things put under him.
<sup>9</sup>But we behold him, who was made a little lower than the
angels, Jesus, on account of the suffering of death, crowned with
glory and honor, in order that he by the grace of God might taste
death for every one. <sup>10</sup>For it became him, for whom are
all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to
glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through
sufferings.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>For both he that sanctifies and they
who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not
ashamed to call them brethren, <sup>12</sup>saying:</p>
<p class="pp2">I will declare thy name to my brethren;</p>
<p class="pp2">In the midst of the congregation I will sing praise
to thee.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>13</sup>And again: <span class="ot">I will put
my trust in him.</span> And again: <span class="ot">Behold, I and
the children whom God gave me.</span> <sup>14</sup>Forasmuch then
as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
in like manner took part in the same; that through death he might
destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil;
<sup>15</sup>and might deliver those who, through fear of death,
were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>For surely he does not succor angels;
but he succors the seed of Abraham. <sup>17</sup>Wherefore, in all
things it became him to be made like to his brethren, that he might
become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to
God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
<sup>18</sup>For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he
is able to help those who are tempted.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the
Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Jesus, <sup>2</sup>who
was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all His
house. <sup>3</sup>For he has been accounted worthy of more glory
than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor
than the house. <sup>4</sup>For every house is builded by some one;
but he who built all things is God. <sup>5</sup>And Moses indeed
was faithful in all His house as a servant, as a testimony of the
things which were to be afterward spoken; <sup>6</sup>but Christ as
son over His house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the
boldness and the joyousness of the hope firm unto the
end<sup><a href="#r580306" id="f580306" title="see footnote" name=
"f580306">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says:</p>
<p class="pp1">To-day, if ye will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>8</sup>Harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation,</p>
<p class="pp1">In the day of the temptation in the wilderness;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>9</sup>Where your fathers tempted me,</p>
<p class="pp1">Proved me, and saw my works, forty years.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>10</sup>Wherefore, I was offended with that
generation;</p>
<p class="pp1">And I said: They always go astray in their
heart,</p>
<p class="pp1">And they knew not my ways;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>11</sup>As I swore in my wrath,</p>
<p class="pp1">They shall not enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Take heed, brethren, lest there shall
be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from
the living God. <sup>13</sup>But exhort one another daily, as long
as it is called To-day, that no one of you may be hardened through
the deceitfulness of sin. <sup>14</sup>For we have become partakers
of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm
unto the end. <sup>15</sup>When it is said: <span class=
"ot">To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as
in the provocation;</span> <sup>16</sup>who then, when they had
heard, provoked? Nay, was it not all who came forth out of Egypt by
Moses? <sup>17</sup>But with whom was he offended forty years? Was
it not with those who sinned? whose carcasses fell in the
wilderness. <sup>18</sup>And to whom did he swear, that they should
not enter into his rest, but to those who believed not?
<sup>19</sup>And we see that they were not able to enter in,
because of unbelief.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;L<span class="sc">et</span> us fear
therefore, lest, a promise being still left us of entering into his
rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.
<sup>2</sup>For to us were the glad tidings preached, as also to
them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being
mingled with faith in those who heard. <sup>3</sup>For we who
believed enter into the rest, as he said: <span class="ot">As I
swore in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest,</span>
although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
<sup>4</sup>For he has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day
thus: <span class="ot">And God rested on the seventh day from all
his works;</span> <sup>5</sup>and in this again: <span class=
"ot">They shall not enter into my rest.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Since then it remains that some do enter
into it, and they to whom the glad tidings were first preached
entered not in because of unbelief, again <sup>7</sup>he limits a
certain day, <span class="ot">To-day</span>, (saying in David,
after so long a time, as has before been said,)</p>
<p class="pp4">To-day, if ye will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="pp4">Harden not your hearts.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>For if Joshua had given them rest, he
would not, after this, have spoken of another day.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>So then, there remains a Sabbath-rest to
the people of God. <sup>10</sup>For he that entered into his rest,
himself rested from his works, as God did from his own.
<sup>11</sup>Let us therefore endeavor to enter into that rest,
that no one may fall into the same example of unbelief.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>For the word of God is living, and
powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to
the dividing of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and is a
discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
<sup>13</sup>And there is no creature that is not manifest in his
sight; but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with
whom we have to do.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Having therefore a great high priest,
who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold fast our profession. <sup>15</sup>For we have not a high
priest who can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,
but who has in all points been tempted in like manner, without sin.
<sup>16</sup>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace,
that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of
need.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class=
"sc">or</span> every high priest, being taken from among men, is
appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer
both gifts and sacrifices for sins; <sup>2</sup>being able to bear
with the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is encompassed
with infirmity; <sup>3</sup>and on account of it he ought, as for
the people, so also for himself, to make offering for sins.
<sup>4</sup>And no one takes to himself the honor, but being called
by God, as was also Aaron. <sup>5</sup>So also Christ did not
glorify himself to be made high priest, but he who spoke to
him:</p>
<p class="pp4">Thou art my Son,</p>
<p class="pp4">I this day have begotten thee;</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>6</sup>as also in another place, he says:</p>
<p class="pp4">Thou art a priest forever,</p>
<p class="pp4">After the order of Melchizedek;</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>7</sup>who, in the days of his flesh offering
up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him
who was able to save him from death, and being heard on account of
his godly fear, <sup>8</sup>though a Son yet learned from what he
suffered the [required] obedience, <sup>9</sup>and being perfected
became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him;
<sup>10</sup>called by God, High Priest<sup><a href="#r580510" id=
"f580510" title="see footnote" name="f580510">10</a></sup>, after
the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Of whom we have much to say, and hard
to be explained, since ye have become dull of hearing.
<sup>12</sup>For though ye ought, on account of the time, to be
teachers, ye again have need that some one teach you the first
principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need
of milk, and not of solid food. <sup>13</sup>For every one who
partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness; for
he is a child. <sup>14</sup>But solid food belongs to those who are
of full age, who by use have their senses exercised to discern good
and evil.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W<span class="sc">herefore</span>,
leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go
on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance
from dead works, and of faith toward God, <sup>2</sup>of the
doctrine of immersions, and of the laying on of hands, and of the
resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. <sup>3</sup>And
this we will do<sup><a href="#r580603" id="f580603" title=
"see footnote" name="f580603">3</a></sup>, if God permit.
<sup>4</sup>For it is impossible that they who have once been
enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and been made
partakers of the Holy Spirit, <sup>5</sup>and have tasted the good
word of God, and the powers of the world to come, <sup>6</sup>and
have fallen away, should again be renewed to repentance; seeing
they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to
open shame. <sup>7</sup>For the earth which has drunk in the rain
oft coming upon it, and brings forth herbs fit for those for whose
sake it is tilled, receives blessing from God; <sup>8</sup>but if
it bears thorns and briers it is rejected, and is near to cursing;
whose end is to be burned.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>But, beloved, we are persuaded of better
things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though
we thus speak. <sup>10</sup>For God is not unrighteous to forget
your work, and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye
ministered and still do minister to the saints.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>But we desire that each one of you show
the same diligence, for the full assurance of the hope unto the
end; <sup>12</sup>that ye may not become slothful, but followers of
those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
<sup>13</sup>For when God made the promise to Abraham, because he
could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,
<sup>14</sup>saying: <span class="ot">Surely, blessing I will bless
thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</span> <sup>15</sup>And
so, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
<sup>16</sup>For men indeed swear by the greater; and the oath is
to them an end of all gainsaying, for a confirmation.
<sup>17</sup>Wherein God, wishing more abundantly to show to the
heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed
with an oath; <sup>18</sup>that by two immutable things, in which
it is impossible that God should lie, we may have strong
encouragement, who fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set
before us, <sup>19</sup>which we have as an anchor of the soul,
sure and steadfast, and entering within the vail;
<sup>20</sup>where as forerunner for us Jesus entered, having
become a high priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class="sc">or</span> this
Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met
Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
<sup>2</sup>to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of all; first
indeed being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King
of Salem, which is, King of peace; <sup>3</sup>without father,
without mother, without table of descent, having neither beginning
of days, nor end of life<sup><a href="#r580703" id="f580703" title=
"see footnote" name="f580703">3</a></sup>, but likened to the Son
of God, remains a priest continually.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Now consider how great this man was, to
whom Abraham the patriarch also gave a tenth of the spoils.
<sup>5</sup>And they indeed that are of the sons of Levi, who
receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take
tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their
brethren, though they have come out of the loins of Abraham;
<sup>6</sup>but he whose descent is not reckoned from them has
taken tithes of Abraham, and has blessed him who had the promises.
<sup>7</sup>And without any contradiction, the less is blessed by
the better. <sup>8</sup>And here indeed men who die receive tithes;
but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives.
<sup>9</sup>And so to speak, Levi also, who receives tithes, has
paid tithes in Abraham; <sup>10</sup>for he was yet in the loins of
his father, when Melchizedek met him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>If therefore perfection were by the
Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the
law), what further need was there that a different priest should
arise, after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the
order of Aaron? <sup>12</sup>For the priesthood being changed, of
necessity there comes also a change of law. <sup>13</sup>For he of
whom these things are spoken pertains to a different tribe, of
which no one has given attendance at the altar. <sup>14</sup>For it
is evident that our Lord has arisen out of Judah; of which tribe
Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. <sup>15</sup>And it is yet
more abundantly manifest, if after the similitude of Melchizedek
there arises a different priest, <sup>16</sup>who has been made,
not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of
an indissoluble life. <sup>17</sup>For it is testified of him:</p>
<p class="pp4">Thou art a priest forever;</p>
<p class="pp4">After the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>For on the one hand, there is an
annulling of the commandment that went before, on account of its
weakness and unprofitableness,&mdash; <sup>19</sup>for the law
perfected nothing,&mdash;and on the other the bringing in of a
better hope, by which we draw near to God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And inasmuch as it was not without an
oath,&mdash; <sup>21</sup>for they indeed were made priests without
an oath, but he with an oath by him who said to him: <span class=
"ot">The Lord swore and will not repent, thou art a priest forever
after the order of Melchizedek</span><sup><a href="#r580721" id=
"f580721" title="see footnote" name="f580721">21</a></sup>,&mdash;
<sup>22</sup>by so much has Jesus become a surety of a better
covenant. <sup>23</sup>And they indeed have been many priests,
because they were hindered by death from continuing;
<sup>24</sup>but he, because he remains forever, has an
unchangeable priesthood. <sup>25</sup>Whence also he is able to
save to the utmost those who come to God through him, since he ever
lives to intercede for them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>For such a high priest became us, holy,
harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than
the heavens; <sup>27</sup>who has not necessity daily, as the high
priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then
for those of the people; for this he did once for all, in offering
up himself. <sup>28</sup>For the law makes men high priests who
have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law,
makes the Son, who is perfected forever.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">VIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> of the
things which we are saying, this is the chief: We have such a high
priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty
of the heavens; <sup>2</sup>a minister of the holy places, and of
the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>For every high priest is appointed to
offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it is necessary, that this
one have something which he may offer. <sup>4</sup>For if he were
on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are those who offer
gifts according to the law, <sup>5</sup>who minister after an
outline and a shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was
admonished by God, when he was about to make the tabernacle; for,
<span class="ot">See</span>, says he, <span class="ot">that thou
make all things according to the pattern which was showed thee in
the mount.</span> <sup>6</sup>But now he has obtained a more
excellent ministry, by so much as he is also mediator of a better
covenant, which has been established upon better promises.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>For if that first had been faultless, a
place would not have been sought for the second. <sup>8</sup>For
finding fault with them, he says<sup><a href="#r580808" id=
"f580808" title="see footnote" name="f580808">8</a></sup>:</p>
<p class="pp2">Behold the days are coming, saith the Lord,</p>
<p class="pp2">When I will make with the house of Israel,</p>
<p class="pp2">And with the house of Judah, a new covenant;</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>9</sup>Not according to the covenant that I
made for their fathers,</p>
<p class="pp2">In the day when I took hold of their hand,</p>
<p class="pp2">To bring them out of the land of Egypt;</p>
<p class="pp2">Because they continued not in my covenant,</p>
<p class="pp2">And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>10</sup>For this is the covenant that I will
establish for the house of Israel,</p>
<p class="pp2">After those days, saith the Lord,</p>
<p class="pp2">Putting my laws into their mind,</p>
<p class="pp2">And on their hearts I will write them;</p>
<p class="pp2">And I will be to them a God,</p>
<p class="pp2">And they shall be to me a people;</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>11</sup>And they shall not teach,</p>
<p class="pp2">Each one his neighbor, and each one his brother,</p>
<p class="pp2">Saying: Know the Lord;</p>
<p class="pp2">Because all shall know me, from the least to the
greatest;</p>
<p class="pp2"><sup>12</sup>Because I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness,</p>
<p class="pp2">And their sins and their iniquities I will remember
no more.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>In that he says, <span class="ot">A
new</span>, he has made the first old. Now that which is grown old,
and worn out with age, is ready to vanish away.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;N<span class="sc">ow</span> the first
had indeed also ordinances of service, and the worldly sanctuary.
<sup>2</sup>For a tabernacle was prepared; the first, wherein is
the lamp-stand, and the table, and the show-bread; which is called
holy. <sup>3</sup>And after the second vail, the tabernacle which
is called most holy, <sup>4</sup>having a golden altar of incense,
and the ark of the covenant overlaid on every side with gold,
wherein was the golden pot containing the manna, and the rod of
Aaron which budded, and the tables of the covenant; <sup>5</sup>and
above it the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of
which we can not now speak particularly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>Now these things being thus prepared,
into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times,
performing the services; <sup>7</sup>but into the second, the high
priest alone, once every year, not without blood, which he offers
for himself, and for the errors of the people; <sup>8</sup>the Holy
Spirit signifying this, that the way into the holy places has not
yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;
<sup>9</sup>which is a figure for the time present, under which are
offered both gifts and sacrifices, unable as to the conscience to
perfect the worshiper; <sup>10</sup>only with meats and
drinks<sup><a href="#r580910" id="f580910" title="see footnote"
name="f580910">10</a></sup>, and divers immersions, ordinances of
the flesh, imposed until the time of reformation. <sup>11</sup>But
Christ, having come as a high priest of the good things to come,
through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with
hands (that is, not of this creation), <sup>12</sup>and not through
the blood of goats and calves but through his own blood, entered
once for all into the holy places, obtaining eternal redemption.
<sup>13</sup>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and ashes of a
heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctifies to the
purity of the flesh; <sup>14</sup>how much more shall the blood of
Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot
to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living
God? <sup>15</sup>And for this cause he is mediator of a new
covenant, in order that, death having taken place, for the
redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, they who
have been called may receive the promise of the eternal
inheritance.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>For where there is a
testament<sup><a href="#r580916" id="f580916" title="see footnote"
name="f580916">16</a></sup>, there must also of necessity be
brought in the death of the testator. <sup>17</sup>For a testament
is of force after men are dead; since it is of no strength at all
while the testator lives.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Wherefore, neither has the first been
dedicated without blood. <sup>19</sup>For, when Moses had spoken
every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the
blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, and scarlet wool,
and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
saying: <sup>20</sup><span class="ot">This is the blood of the
covenant, which God enjoined in respect to you.</span>
<sup>21</sup>And moreover, the tabernacle, and all the vessels of
the service, he in like manner sprinkled with blood.
<sup>22</sup>And nearly all things are cleansed according to the
law with blood; and without shedding of blood there is no
remission.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>It was therefore necessary, that the
outlines of things in the heavens should be cleansed with these;
but the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than
these. <sup>24</sup>For Christ entered not into holy places made
with hands, figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to
appear in the presence of God for us; <sup>25</sup>nor yet that he
should many times offer himself, as the high priest enters into the
holy places every year with blood of others; <sup>26</sup>for then
must he many times have suffered since the foundation of the world;
but now once, in the end of the ages, he has been manifested for
the putting away of sin by the sacrifice of himself<sup><a href=
"#r580926" id="f580926" title="see footnote" name=
"f580926">26</a></sup>. <sup>27</sup>And inasmuch as it is
appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment;
<sup>28</sup>so also the Christ, having been once offered to bear
the sins of many, will to those who look for him appear a second
time without sin, unto salvation.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;F<span class=
"sc">or</span> the law having a shadow of the good things to come,
not the very image of the things, can never, with the same
sacrifices which they offer year by year continually, make those
who come to them<sup><a href="#r581001" id="f581001" title=
"see footnote" name="f581001">1</a></sup> perfect. <sup>2</sup>For
then would they not have ceased to be offered, because the
worshipers would have had no more consciousness of sins, having
once been cleansed? <sup>3</sup>But in them there is a remembrance
of sins year by year. <sup>4</sup>For it is impossible that the
blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
<sup>5</sup>Wherefore, when he comes into the world, he says:</p>
<p class="pp1">Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not,</p>
<p class="pp1">But a body didst thou prepare for me;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>6</sup>In whole burnt-offerings, and sacrifices
for sin, thou hadst no pleasure.</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>7</sup>Then said I: Lo, I come,</p>
<p class="pp1">In the volume of the book it is written of me,</p>
<p class="pp1">To do thy will, O God.</p>
<p class="pnn"><sup>8</sup>Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings
and whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not,
nor hadst pleasure therein, which are offered by the law,
<sup>9</sup>then has he said: Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He
takes away the first, that he may establish the second.
<sup>10</sup>In which will we have been sanctified, through the
offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And every priest<sup><a href="#r581011"
id="f581011" title="see footnote" name="f581011">11</a></sup>
indeed stands daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the same
sacrifices, which can never take away sins; <sup>12</sup>but he,
having offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the
right hand of God; <sup>13</sup>from henceforth expecting until his
enemies be made his footstool. <sup>14</sup>For by one offering he
has perfected forever those who are sanctified.
<sup>15</sup>Moreover, the Holy Spirit also is a witness to us; for
after he had said, <sup>16</sup><span class="ot">This is the
covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the
Lord, putting my laws upon their hearts, and on their minds I will
write them,</span> [he further says,] <sup>17</sup><span class=
"ot">and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.</span>
<sup>18</sup>But where there is remission of these, there is no
longer offering for sin.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Having therefore, brethren, boldness as
to the entrance into the holy places by the blood of Jesus, which
[entrance] he instituted for us, <sup>20</sup>a new and living way,
through the vail, that is to say, his flesh; <sup>21</sup>and
having a great priest over the house of God; <sup>22</sup>Let us
draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having had
our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience; and having had our
body washed with pure water, <sup>23</sup>let us hold fast the
profession of the hope without wavering, for he is faithful who
promised; <sup>24</sup>and let us consider one another, to incite
to love and to good works; <sup>25</sup>not forsaking the
assembling of ourselves together, as is the custom of some, but
exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>For if we willingly sin, after having
received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a
sacrifice for sins, <sup>27</sup>but a certain fearful looking for
of judgment, and a fiery indignation, which will devour the
adversaries. <sup>28</sup>He that despised Moses' law died without
mercy, under two or three witnesses. <sup>29</sup>Of how much worse
punishment, suppose ye, will he be thought worthy, who has trodden
under foot the Son of God, and has accounted the blood of the
covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has
done despite to the Spirit of grace? <sup>30</sup>For we know him
who said: <span class="ot">To me belongs vengeance; I will
recompense, saith the Lord;</span> and again: <span class="ot">The
Lord will judge his people.</span> <sup>31</sup>It is a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>But call to remembrance the former
days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great
contest of sufferings; <sup>33</sup>partly, whilst ye were made a
spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye
became partakers with those who were so used. <sup>34</sup>For ye
sympathized with those in bonds, and ye took joyfully the
plundering of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a
better and an enduring substance.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>Cast not away therefore your
confidence, which has great recompense of reward. <sup>36</sup>For
ye have need of patience, that having done the will of God ye may
receive the promise. <sup>37</sup>For yet a little while,
<span class="ot">he that is to come will come, and will not
delay.</span> <sup>38</sup>Now, <span class="ot">the just shall
live by faith; but if he draw back, my soul has no pleasure in
him.</span> <sup>39</sup>But we are not of those who draw back unto
perdition; but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

the assurance of things hoped for<sup><a href="#r581101" id=

conviction of things not seen. <sup>2</sup>For in this the elders
obtained a good report.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Through faith we perceive that the
worlds were framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not
arisen<sup><a href="#r581103" id="f581103" title="see footnote"
name="f581103">3</a></sup> out of things which appear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>By faith Abel offered to God a more
excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he received testimony that
he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it,
being dead, he yet speaks.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>By faith Enoch was translated, that he
should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated
him; for before his translation, he has had the testimony that he
pleased God. <sup>6</sup>But without faith it is impossible to
please him; for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and
that he is a rewarder to those who seek after him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>By faith Noah, being warned by God
concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark
for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and
became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>By faith Abraham when called obeyed, to
go forth into a place which he should afterward receive for an
inheritance, and went forth, not knowing whither he went.
<sup>9</sup>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as a
foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with
him of the same promise; <sup>10</sup>for he looked for the city
which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>By faith Sarah herself also received
power to conceive seed, even when she was past age, because she
accounted him faithful who had promised. <sup>12</sup>Wherefore
also there sprang from one, and him become as dead, even as the
stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea
shore innumerable.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>These all died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having seen them from afar, and greeted
them, and professed that they were strangers and sojourners on the
earth. <sup>14</sup>For they that say such things declare plainly,
that they are seeking a country. <sup>15</sup>And if indeed, they
had in mind that from which they came out, they would have had
opportunity to return. <sup>16</sup>But now<sup><a href="#r581116"
id="f581116" title="see footnote" name="f581116">16</a></sup> they
desire a better, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed
to be called their God; for he prepared for them a city.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>By faith Abraham, when tried, has
offered up Isaac; and he who had accepted the promises offered up
his only begotten, <sup>18</sup>of whom it was said: <span class=
"ot">In Isaac shall thy seed be called;</span>
<sup>19</sup>accounting that God is able even to raise from the
dead; whence he also received him back in a figure.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau,
concerning things to come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed
each of the sons of Joseph; <span class="ot">and he worshiped,
[leaning] on the top of his staff.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>By faith Joseph, when dying, made
mention of the departure of the sons of Israel, and gave
commandment concerning his bones.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>By faith Moses, when born, was hidden
three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was
fair; and they feared not the king's commandment.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>By faith Moses, when grown up, refused
to be called son of a daughter of Pharaoh; <sup>25</sup>choosing
rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy
the pleasures of sin for a season; <sup>26</sup>esteeming the
reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for
he looked for the reward.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing
the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is
invisible.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Through faith he has kept the passover,
and the affusion of the blood, that he who destroyed the first-born
might not touch them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>29</sup>By faith they passed through the Red
sea as by dry land; which the Egyptians attempting were swallowed
up.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>30</sup>By faith the walls of Jericho fell,
after they had been encompassed during seven days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>31</sup>By faith Rahab the harlot did not
perish with those who believed not<sup><a href="#r581131" id=

having received the spies with peace.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>32</sup>And why say I more? For the time would
fail me to tell of Gideon, of Barak and Samson and Jephthah, of
David and Samuel and the prophets; <sup>33</sup>who through faith
subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped
the mouths of lions, <sup>34</sup>quenched the power of fire,
escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong,
became mighty in war, turned to flight the armies of the
aliens.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>35</sup>Women received their dead, by
resurrection to life; and others were tortured, not accepting
deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>36</sup>And others had trial of mockings, and
scourgings, and, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.
<sup>37</sup>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were
tempted, they were slain with the sword; they went about in
sheep-skins and goats' skins, being destitute, afflicted,
tormented; <sup>38</sup>of whom the world was not worthy; wandering
in deserts and mountains and caves, and the clefts of the
earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>39</sup>And all these, having obtained a good
report through faith, did not receive the promise; <sup>40</sup>God
having provided something better concerning us, that they should
not without us be made perfect.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class="sc">herefore</span>, let
us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding, us, lay
aside every weight, and the easily besetting sin, and with patience
run the race that is set before us, <sup>2</sup>looking away to the
author and finisher of the faith, Jesus; who for the joy set before
him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the
right hand of the throne of God. <sup>3</sup>For consider him who
has endured such contradiction by sinners against him, that ye
become not weary, fainting in your souls.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Not yet did ye resist unto blood,
contending against sin; <sup>5</sup>and ye have forgotten the
exhortation, which discourses with you as with sons:</p>
<p class="pp1">My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord,</p>
<p class="pp1">Nor faint when reproved by him;</p>
<p class="pp1"><sup>6</sup>For whom the Lord loves he chastens,</p>
<p class="pp1">And scourges every son whom he receives.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>If ye endure chastening, God deals with
you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father chastens
not? <sup>8</sup>But if ye are without chastening, of which all
have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Furthermore, we had fathers of our
flesh, who chastened us, and we gave them reverence; shall we not
much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
<sup>10</sup>For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed
good to them; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of
his holiness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Now all chastening for the present
indeed seems not joyous, but grievous; but afterward, it yields the
peaceable fruit of righteousness, to those who have been exercised
thereby.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Wherefore lift up the hands which hang
down, and the feeble knees; <sup>13</sup>and make straight paths
for your feet, that the lame be not turned out of the way, but
rather be healed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Follow peace with all, and holiness,
without which no one shall see the Lord; <sup>15</sup>looking
diligently, lest any one come short of the grace of God; lest any
root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and the many be
thereby defiled; <sup>16</sup>lest there be any fornicator, or
profane person, as Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright.
<sup>17</sup>For ye know that he also afterward, when he wished to
inherit the blessing, was rejected; for he found no place of
repentance, though he sought after it with tears.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>For ye have not come to a mount that is
touched, and burning with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and
tempest, <sup>19</sup>and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of
words; which voice they who heard refused that more should be
spoken to them; <sup>20</sup>for they could not bear that which was
commanded, <span class="ot">Even if a beast touch the mountain, it
shall be stoned;</span> <sup>21</sup>and so terrible was the sight,
that Moses said: <span class="ot">I fear, and tremble.</span>
<sup>22</sup>But ye have come to mount Zion, and to the city of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
<sup>23</sup>to the general assembly and church of the first-born,
who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the
spirits of just ones made perfect; <sup>24</sup>and to Jesus the
mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that
speaks better than Abel.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>See that ye refuse not him who speaks;
for if they did not escape, refusing him who declared the divine
will on earth, much more shall not we, who turn away from him who
speaks from heaven; <sup>26</sup>whose voice then shook the earth;
but now he has promised, saying: <span class="ot">Yet once more I
shake, not the earth only, but also heaven.</span> <sup>27</sup>And
this, <span class="ot">Yet once more</span>, signifies the removing
of the things shaken, as of things that have been made, that the
things which are not shaken may remain.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>Wherefore, receiving a kingdom which
can not be shaken, let us have grace whereby we may serve God
acceptably, with reverence and godly fear; <sup>29</sup>for our God
is a consuming fire.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;L<span class="sc">et</span> brotherly
love continue.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers;
for thereby some entertained angels unawares.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Remember those in bonds, as bound with
them; those in adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Marriage is honorable in all, and the
bed undefiled<sup><a href="#r581304" id="f581304" title=

adulterers God will judge.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Let your disposition be without
covetousness, and be content with what ye have; for he has said:
<span class="ot">I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</span>
<sup>6</sup>So that we boldly say:</p>
<p class="pp3">The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear;</p>
<p class="pp3">What shall man do to me?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Remember those who were your leaders,
who spoke to you the word of God; considering the end of whose
manner of life, imitate their faith.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Jesus Christ is yesterday and to-day the
same, and forever. <sup>9</sup>Be not carried away with various and
strange teachings; for it is good that the heart be established
with grace, not with meats, which did not profit those who walked
therein.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>We have an altar, whereof they have no
right to eat who serve the tabernacle. <sup>11</sup>For the bodies
of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holy places by the
high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
<sup>12</sup>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the
people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.
<sup>13</sup>So then, let us go forth to him without the camp,
bearing his reproach. <sup>14</sup>For here we have not an abiding
city, but are seeking for that which is to come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Through him, therefore, let us offer up
the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of
lips giving thanks to his name. <sup>16</sup>But to do good and to
communicate forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well
pleased.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Obey those who are your leaders, and
submit; for they watch for your souls, as those who shall give
account; that they may do this with joy, and not with sighing, for
that is unprofitable for you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Pray for us; for we are persuaded that
we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to deport
ourselves well. <sup>19</sup>But I the more earnestly beseech you
to do this, that I may the sooner be restored to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Now the God of peace, who brought up
from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep in
virtue of the blood of an eternal covenant, <sup>21</sup>make you
perfect in every good work to do his will, doing in you that which
is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the
glory, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>But I beseech you, brethren, bear with
the word of exhortation; for I wrote to you in few words.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>Know that the brother, Timothy, has
been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see
you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Salute all that are your leaders, and
all the saints. Those of Italy salute you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>25</sup>Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>

greeting.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye
fall into various temptations; <sup>3</sup>knowing that the proving
of your faith works patience. <sup>4</sup>But let patience have a
perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in
nothing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>But if any one of you is lacking in
wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally, and
upbraids not, and it will be given him. <sup>6</sup>But let him ask
in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavers is like a wave of
the sea driven by the wind and tossed. <sup>7</sup>For let not that
man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord;
<sup>8</sup>a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Let the brother of low degree glory in
that he is exalted; <sup>10</sup>but the rich, in that he is made
low; because as the flower of the grass he will pass away.
<sup>11</sup>For the sun rose with the burning heat, and withered
the grass, and its flower fell off, and the grace of its fashion
perished; so also will the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Happy is the man that endures
temptation; because, when he is approved, he will receive the crown
of life, which He promised to those who love him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Let no one say when he is tempted, I am
tempted by God; for God can not be tempted with evil, and himself
tempts no one. <sup>14</sup>But each one is tempted, when by his
own lust he is drawn away and enticed. <sup>15</sup>Then lust,
having conceived, brings forth sin; and sin, when completed, brings
forth death.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Do not err, my beloved brethren.
<sup>17</sup>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,
coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom there is no
variableness, or shadow of turning. <sup>18</sup>Of his own will he
begot us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of
first-fruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>So that, my beloved brethren, let every
man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;
<sup>20</sup>for the wrath of man works not the righteousness of
God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Wherefore, putting off all filthiness
and excess of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word,
which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>But be doers of the word, and not
hearers only, deceiving yourselves. <sup>23</sup>For if any one is
a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding
his natural face in a mirror. <sup>24</sup>For he beheld himself,
and has gone away; and immediately he forgot what manner of man he
was. <sup>25</sup>But he who looked into the perfect law, the law
of liberty, and remained thereby, being not a forgetful hearer, but
a doer of work, this man shall be happy in his doing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>If any one thinks that he is religious,
and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's
religion is vain.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>27</sup>Religion, pure and undefiled before God
and the Father, is this: To visit the orphans and widows in their
affliction; to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;M<span class="sc">y</span> brethren,
hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory,
with respect of persons. <sup>2</sup>For if there have come into
your assembly a man with a gold ring, in gay clothing, and there
have come in also a poor man in mean clothing; <sup>3</sup>and ye
have respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say: Sit thou
here in a good place, and say to the poor man: Stand thou there,
or, Sit under my footstool; <sup>4</sup>were ye not partial in
yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>Hearken, my beloved brethren. Did not
God choose the poor as to this world<sup><a href="#r590205" id=
"f590205" title="see footnote" name="f590205">5</a></sup> to be
rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those
who love him? <sup>6</sup>But ye dishonored the poor man. Do not
the rich oppress you, and do not they drag you before the
judgment-seats? <sup>7</sup>Do not they blaspheme the worthy name
by which ye are called?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>If indeed ye fulfill the royal law,
according to the scripture, <span class="ot">Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself</span>, ye do well. <sup>9</sup>But if ye have
respect to persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as
transgressors. <sup>10</sup>For whoever shall keep the whole law,
and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. <sup>11</sup>For
he who said: <span class="ot">Do not commit adultery</span>, said
also: <span class="ot">Do not kill.</span> Now if thou commit not
adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the
law. <sup>12</sup>So speak, and so do, as they that shall be judged
by the law of liberty. <sup>13</sup>For the judgment shall be
without mercy, to him that showed no mercy. Mercy glories over
judgment.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>What does it profit, my brethren, if
any one say that he has faith, and have not works? Can the faith
save him? <sup>15</sup>But if a brother or a sister be naked, and
destitute of daily food, <sup>16</sup>and one of you say to them:
Depart in peace, be warmed, and be filled, but ye give them not the
things needful for the body, what does it profit? <sup>17</sup>So
also faith, if it has not works, is dead in itself.
<sup>18</sup>But some will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works;
show me thy faith without the works, and I will show thee the faith
by my works. <sup>19</sup>Thou believest that God is one. Thou
doest well; the demons also believe, and tremble. <sup>20</sup>But
wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>Was not Abraham our father justified by
works, when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
<sup>22</sup>Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by
works was faith made complete. <sup>23</sup>And the scripture was
fulfilled which says: <span class="ot">Abraham believed God, and it
was reckoned to him for righteousness</span>; and he was called,
Friend of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Ye see that by works a man is
justified, and not by faith only. <sup>25</sup>And in like manner,
was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she received
the messengers, and sent them out by another way? <sup>26</sup>For
as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works
is dead.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;M<span class="sc">y</span> brethren,
be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive greater
condemnation. <sup>2</sup>For in many things we all offend. If any
one offends not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle
also the whole body.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Now if we put the bits into the horses'
mouths<sup><a href="#r590303" id="f590303" title="see footnote"
name="f590303">3</a></sup>, that they may obey us, we turn about
also their whole body. <sup>4</sup>Behold also the ships, though
they are so great, and driven by fierce winds, are turned about by
a very small helm, whithersoever the steersman may desire.
<sup>5</sup>So also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great
things. Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindles!
<sup>6</sup>And the tongue is a fire, that world of iniquity! The
tongue among our members is that which defiles the whole body, and
sets on fire the course of life, and is set on fire by hell.
<sup>7</sup>For every nature of beasts and birds, of reptiles and
things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed, by the nature of
man. <sup>8</sup>But the tongue no man can tame; a restless evil,
full of deadly poison. <sup>9</sup>Therewith we bless the Lord and
Father; and therewith we curse men, who have been made after the
likeness of God. <sup>10</sup>Out of the same mouth comes forth
blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
<sup>11</sup>Does the fountain, out of the same opening, send forth
the sweet and the bitter? <sup>12</sup>Can a fig-tree, my brethren,
bear olives, or a vine figs? Neither can salt water yield
fresh.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Who is wise and endued with knowledge
among you? Let him show, out of his good deportment, his works in
meekness of wisdom. <sup>14</sup>But if ye have bitter envying and
strife in your hearts, do not glory, and lie against the truth.
<sup>15</sup>This wisdom is not one that comes down from above, but
earthly, sensual<sup><a href="#r590316" id="f590316" title=
"see footnote" name="f590316">16</a></sup>, devilish.
<sup>16</sup>For where there is emulation and strife, there is
confusion and every evil work. <sup>17</sup>But the wisdom from
above is first pure, then peaceable, forbearing, easily persuaded,
full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without
hypocrisy. <sup>18</sup>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in
peace, by those who work peace.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

wars, and from whence are fightings among you? Are they not from
hence, from your lusts that war in your members? <sup>2</sup>Ye
desire, and have not; ye kill, and envy, and can not obtain; ye
fight and war. Ye have not, because ye ask not; <sup>3</sup>ye ask,
and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon
your lusts.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the
friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore
desires to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
<sup>5</sup>Do ye think that the Scripture says in vain, the spirit
he made to dwell in us has jealous longings? <sup>6</sup>But he
gives the more grace. Wherefore he says:</p>
<p class="pp4">God resists the proud,</p>
<p class="pp4">But gives grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Submit yourselves therefore to God.
Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. <sup>8</sup>Draw nigh
to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye
sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded. <sup>9</sup>Be
afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned into
mourning, and your joy into heaviness. <sup>10</sup>Humble
yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Do not speak against one another,
brethren. He that speaks against his brother, or judges his
brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law. But if thou
judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
<sup>12</sup>One is the lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save
and to destroy. Who art thou that judgest thy neighbor?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Come now, ye that say: To-day and
to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend one year there, and
buy and sell, and get gain; <sup>14</sup>(whereas ye know not what
belongs to the morrow; for what is your life? for ye are a vapor,
that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away;)
<sup>15</sup>instead of saying: If the Lord will, we shall both
live, and do this or that. <sup>16</sup>But now ye glory in your
boastings. All such glorying is evil. <sup>17</sup>Therefore to him
that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;C<span class=

are coming upon you. <sup>2</sup>Your riches are corrupted, and
your garments are become moth-eaten. <sup>3</sup>Your gold and
silver is rusted; and the rust of them will be a witness against
you, and will eat your flesh as fire. Ye heaped up treasure, in the
last days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Behold, the hire of the laborers who
reaped your fields, which is fraudulently kept back by you, cries
out; and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears
of the Lord of Sabaoth<sup><a href="#r590504" id="f590504" title=
"see footnote" name="f590504">4</a></sup>. <sup>5</sup>Ye have been
luxurious on the earth, and lived in pleasure; ye have nourished
your hearts, in the day of slaughter. <sup>6</sup>Ye have
condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not resist you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Be patient therefore, brethren, until
the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waits for the
precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, till it shall
have received the early and latter rain. <sup>8</sup>Be ye also
patient; establish your hearts, because the coming of the Lord
draws nigh. <sup>9</sup>Murmur not against one another, brethren,
that ye be not judged. Behold, the judge stands before the door.
<sup>10</sup>Take, my brethren, the prophets, who spoke in the name
of the Lord, for an example of affliction, and of patience.
<sup>11</sup>Behold, we count those happy who endure. Ye heard of
the patience of Job, and saw the end of the Lord<sup><a href=
"#r590511" id="f590511" title="see footnote" name=
"f590511">11</a></sup>; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of
tender mercy.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>But above all things, my brethren,
swear not; neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other
oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not
under condemnation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Is any afflicted among you, let him
pray. Is any cheerful, let him sing praise. <sup>14</sup>Is any
sick among you, let him call for the elders of the church; and let
them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
<sup>15</sup>And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the
Lord will raise him up; and even if he have committed sins, it will
be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>Confess therefore your trespasses to
one another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed. The
earnest prayer of a righteous man avails much. <sup>17</sup>Elijah
was a man of like nature with us; and he prayed earnestly that it
might not rain, and it rained not on the earth for three years and
six months. <sup>18</sup>And again he prayed, and the heaven gave
rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Brethren, if any one among you be led
astray from the truth, and one convert him; <sup>20</sup>let him
know, that he who converts a sinner from the error of his way will
save a soul from death, and will hide a multitude of sins.</p>

Asia, and Bithynia; <sup>2</sup>chosen according to the
foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit,
unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace
and peace be multiplied to you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Blessed be the God and Father of our

again unto a living hope<sup><a href="#r600103" id="f600103" title=

of Jesus Christ from the dead; <sup>4</sup>unto an inheritance
imperishable, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven for
you, <sup>5</sup>who by the power of God are kept through faith,
unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
<sup>6</sup>Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little
time, if need be, made sorrowful by manifold trials;
<sup>7</sup>that the proof of your faith, much more precious than
gold that perishes, but is proved by fire, may be found unto praise
and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
<sup>8</sup>whom having not seen ye love; in whom, though now ye
see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and
full of glory; <sup>9</sup>receiving the end of your faith, the
salvation of your souls.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Concerning which salvation the prophets
diligently sought and searched, who prophesied of the grace toward
you; <sup>11</sup>searching as to what or what manner of time the
Spirit of Christ which was in them signified, when it testified
beforehand the sufferings destined for Christ, and the glories that
should follow; <sup>12</sup>to whom it was revealed, that not to
themselves, but to you they were ministering them, which now have
been announced to you, through those who brought you the good news
by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; which things angels desire to
look into.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Wherefore, girding up the loins of your
mind, be sober, and hope perfectly for the grace that is to be
brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; <sup>14</sup>as
children of obedience, not conforming yourselves to the former
lusts in your ignorance; <sup>15</sup>but as he who called you is
holy, be ye yourselves holy in all your deportment;
<sup>16</sup>because it is written: <span class="ot">Ye shall be
holy, for I am holy.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And if ye call him Father<sup><a href=

according to each one's work, pass the time of your sojourning in
fear; <sup>18</sup>knowing that not with perishable things, silver
and gold, ye were redeemed from your vain course of life received
by tradition from your fathers, <sup>19</sup>but with the precious
blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot;
<sup>20</sup>who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the
world, but manifested in these last times for you, <sup>21</sup>who
through him believe on God, who raised him from the dead, and gave
him glory; so that your faith and hope are on God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>Having purified your souls in obeying
the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love, love one another from the

therefore all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings,
and all backbitings, <sup>2</sup>as newborn babes, long for the
spiritual, unadulterated milk, that ye thereby may grow unto
salvation; <sup>3</sup>if indeed ye tasted that the Lord is
gracious; <sup>4</sup>to whom coming, a living stone, disallowed
indeed by men, but with God chosen, honored, <sup>5</sup>ye
yourselves also, as living stones, are built up<sup><a href=
"#r600205" id="f600205" title="see footnote" name=
"f600205">5</a></sup> a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to
offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus
Christ. <sup>6</sup>Because it is contained in the Scripture:
<span class="ot">Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone,
chosen, honored; and he that believes on him shall not be put to
shame.</span></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>To you therefore who believe is the
honor; but to the disobedient, <span class="ot">the stone which the
builders disallowed, the same is become the head of the
corner,</span> <sup>8</sup><span class="ot">and a stone of
stumbling, and a rock of offense,</span> who stumble, being
disobedient to the word; to which they were also appointed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession; that ye
should show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of
darkness into his marvelous light; <sup>10</sup>who once were not a
people, but are now the people of God; who had not obtained mercy,
but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Beloved, I exhort you as sojourners and
strangers, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the
soul; <sup>12</sup>having your deportment honorable among the
Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they
may from your good works, beholding them, glorify God in the day of
visitation.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>Submit yourselves to every human
institution, for the Lord's sake; whether to the king, as
pre-eminent, <sup>14</sup>or to governors as being sent by him for
the punishment of evil-doers, and the praise of those who do well.
<sup>15</sup>For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may
put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men; <sup>16</sup>as
free, and as not having your freedom for a vail of wickedness, but
as God's servants.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Honor all men; love the brotherhood;
fear God; honor the king; <sup>18</sup>ye servants, being in
subjection to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and
reasonable, but also to the perverse. <sup>19</sup>For this is
acceptable, if a man for conscience toward God<sup><a href=
"#r600219" id="f600219" title="see footnote" name=
"f600219">19</a></sup> endures griefs, suffering wrongfully.
<sup>20</sup>For what glory is it, if when ye are beaten for your
faults, ye shall take it patiently? But if when ye do well, and
suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
<sup>21</sup>For to this ye were called; because Christ also
suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his
steps; <sup>22</sup><span class="ot">who committed no sin, neither
was guile found in his mouth;</span> <sup>23</sup>who when he was
reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but
committed it to him who judges righteously; <sup>24</sup>who
himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, having
died to our sins, should live to righteousness; <span class="ot">by
whose stripes ye were healed.</span> <sup>25</sup>For ye were going
astray like sheep; but have returned now unto the Shepherd and
Overseer of your souls.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I<span class="sc">n</span> like
manner, ye wives, being in subjection to your own husbands; that
even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be won by
the deportment of their wives, <sup>2</sup>when they behold your
chaste deportment coupled with fear. <sup>3</sup>Whose adorning,
let it not be the outward one of braiding the hair, and of wearing
golden ornaments, or of putting on apparel; <sup>4</sup>but the
hidden man of the heart, in that which is imperishable of the meek
and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.
<sup>5</sup>For so in the old time the holy women also, who hoped
in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own
husbands, <sup>6</sup>(as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord;
of whom ye became children,) doing good, and fearing no alarm.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Ye husbands, in like manner, dwelling
with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the female, as
the weaker vessel, as also heirs together of the grace of life;
that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Finally, all being of one mind,
sympathizing, loving the brethren, tender-hearted, humble-minded;
<sup>9</sup>not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing;
but on the contrary blessing, because to this end ye were called,
that ye might inherit blessing.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup><span class="ot">For he who desires to
love life, and to see good days, let him refrain his tongue from
evil, and his lips from speaking guile;</span>
<sup>11</sup><span class="ot">let him turn away from evil, and do
good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.</span>
<sup>12</sup><span class="ot">Because the eyes of the Lord are upon
the righteous, and his ears are toward their supplications; but the
face of the Lord is against those who do evil.</span>
<sup>13</sup>And who is he that shall harm you, if ye are followers
of that which is good? <sup>14</sup>But if ye even suffer for
righteousness' sake, happy are ye; but <span class="ot">fear not
with their fear, nor be troubled;</span> <sup>15</sup><span class=
"ot">but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts;</span> ready
always to give an answer to every one that asks you a reason of the
hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; <sup>16</sup>having a
good conscience, that wherein they speak against you as evil-doers,
they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good deportment in
Christ. <sup>17</sup>For it is better, if it be the will of God,
that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.
<sup>18</sup>Because Christ also suffered once for sins, the just
for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death
in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit; <sup>19</sup>in which
also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,
<sup>20</sup>who were disobedient in times past, when the
long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was
preparing, wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through
water; <sup>21</sup>which in an antitype, immersion, now saves us
also (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
requirement of a good conscience toward God), by the resurrection
of Jesus Christ; <sup>22</sup>who is on the right hand of God,
having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being
made subject to him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;C<span class="sc">hrist</span> then
having suffered for us in the flesh, do ye also arm yourselves with
the same mind; because he who suffered in the flesh has ceased from
sin; <sup>2</sup>that ye no longer may live the remaining time in
the flesh by the lusts of men, but by the will of God.
<sup>3</sup>For the time past suffices us to have wrought the will
of the Gentiles, when we walked in wantonness, lusts, excess of
wine, revelings, carousings, and unhallowed idolatries;
<sup>4</sup>at which thing they are astonished, as ye run not with
them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you;
<sup>5</sup>who shall give account to him who is ready to judge the
living and the dead. <sup>6</sup>For to this end was the good news
preached also to those who are dead, that they might indeed be
judged according to men in the flesh, but may live according to God
in the spirit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>But the end of all things is at hand. Be
therefore sober, and watch unto prayer; <sup>8</sup>but above all
things having your love toward one another fervent, because
<span class="ot">love covers a multitude of sins;</span>
<sup>9</sup>hospitable to one another, without grudging;
<sup>10</sup>according as each received a gift, ministering the
same to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;
<sup>11</sup>if any one speaks, as [uttering] God's oracles; if any
one ministers, as of the ability which God bestows; that God in all
things may be glorified, through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory
and the dominion, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Beloved, be not astonished at the fiery
test taking place among you to prove you, as though a strange thing
were befalling you; <sup>13</sup>but, in so far as ye share in
Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that also, at the revelation of his
glory, ye may rejoice with exceeding joy. <sup>14</sup>If ye are
reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; because the spirit
of glory and of God rests upon you; [on their part he is evil
spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.]<sup><a href=
"#r600414" id="f600414" title="see footnote" name=
"f600414">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>For let none of you suffer as a
murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a busy-body in other
men's matters; <sup>16</sup>but if as a Christian, let him not be
ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name. <sup>17</sup>Because
the time is come that judgment should begin from the house of God;
but if it begin first from us, what shall be the end of those who
obey not the gospel of God? <sup>18</sup>And if the righteous is
with difficulty saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner
appear?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>Wherefore let those also, who suffer
according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to
him in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class=

and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker
of the glory that shall be revealed; <sup>2</sup>tend the flock of
God which is among you, overseeing it not by constraint but
willingly, not for base gain but with good will;
<sup>3</sup>neither as being lords over the heritage, but being
examples to the flock. <sup>4</sup>And when the chief Shepherd is
manifested, ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>In like manner, ye younger, submit
yourselves to the elder. Yea, all of you submitting to one another,
gird yourselves with humility; because, <span class="ot">God
resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</span>
<sup>6</sup>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of
God, that he may exalt you in due time; <sup>7</sup>casting all
your care upon him, because he cares for you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary
the Devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may
devour; <sup>9</sup>whom resist, steadfast in the faith, knowing
that the same sufferings are being accomplished in your brethren
that are in the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>But the God of all grace, who called
you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after ye have suffered a
little while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.

ever. Amen.</p>

consider, I wrote to you in few words, exhorting, and testifying
that this is the true grace of God, wherein ye stand.</p>

righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: <sup>2</sup>Grace
and peace be multiplied to you, in the knowledge of God, and of
Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Seeing that his divine power has given
us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the
knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and might;
<sup>4</sup>through which he has given us exceeding great and
precious promises, that by these ye may become partakers of the
divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the
world through lust; <sup>5</sup>yea for this very reason, giving
all diligence, add to your faith fortitude; and to fortitude,
knowledge<sup><a href="#r610105" id="f610105" title="see footnote"

self-control; and to self-control, patience; and to patience,
godliness; <sup>7</sup>and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to
brotherly kindness, love. <sup>8</sup>For if these things are in
you, and abound, they cause that ye shall not be inactive nor
unfruitful in attaining to the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ. <sup>9</sup>But he that lacks these things is blind, not
seeing afar off, having forgotten the cleansing away of his old
sins.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give
diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do
these things, ye shall never fall. <sup>11</sup>For so shall be
richly ministered to you the entrance into the everlasting kingdom
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Wherefore, I will not neglect to put
you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and
are established in the truth that is with you. <sup>13</sup>But I
think it right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up
by putting you in remembrance; <sup>14</sup>knowing that I must
soon put off my tabernacle<sup><a href="#r610114" id="f610114"

Jesus Christ showed me. <sup>15</sup>Moreover I will endeavor that
at all times ye may be able after my departure to call these things
to mind.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>For we did not follow cunningly devised
fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.
<sup>17</sup>For he received from God the Father honor and glory,
when such a voice was borne to him from the excellent glory: This
is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; <sup>18</sup>and this
voice we heard borne from heaven, being with him in the holy mount.
<sup>19</sup>And we have more sure the prophetic word; to which ye
do well that ye take heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place,
until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts;
<sup>20</sup>knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture
comes of private interpretation; <sup>21</sup>for prophecy was
never brought by the will of man; but moved by the Holy Spirit, men
spoke from God.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

false prophets also among the people, as there will be false

themselves swift destruction. <sup>2</sup>And many will follow
their dissolute ways; by reason of whom the way of truth will be
evil spoken of. <sup>3</sup>And in covetousness will they with
feigned words make merchandise of you; for whom the judgment from
of old lingers not, and their destruction slumbers not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>For if God spared not angels, having

of Sodom and Gomorrah condemned them to overthrow, having made them
an example of those who should afterward live ungodly;

conduct of the lawless; <sup>8</sup>(for that righteous man,
dwelling among them, with seeing and hearing vexed his righteous
soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) <sup>9</sup>the
Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to
reserve the unjust under punishment to the day of judgment;
<sup>10</sup>but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust
of uncleanness, and despise dominion. Presumptuous, self-willed,
they are not afraid to rail at dignities; <sup>11</sup>whereas
angels, being greater in strength and power, bring not a railing
judgment against them before the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>But these, as natural brute beasts born
to be taken<sup><a href="#r610212" id="f610212" title=
"see footnote" name="f610212">12</a></sup> and destroyed, railing
at things that they understand not, shall utterly perish in their
own corruption, <sup>13</sup>receiving the wages of
unrighteousness, as they who account reveling for a day pleasure;
spots, and blemishes, reveling in their own deceits while feasting
with you; <sup>14</sup>having eyes full of the adulteress, and that
cease not from sin; alluring unstable souls; having a heart
exercised in covetousness; children of a curse;
<sup>15</sup>forsaking the right way, they went astray, following
the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness, <sup>16</sup>but was rebuked for his iniquity; the
dumb ass, speaking with man's voice, forbade the madness of the
prophet.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>These are wells without water, mists
driven by a tempest, to whom the blackness of darkness is reserved
forever. <sup>18</sup>For, speaking swelling words of vanity, in
lusts of the flesh they allure, by wanton ways, such as partly
escape those who live in error; <sup>19</sup>promising them
liberty, while they themselves are servants of corruption; for by
what a man is overcome, by the same he is also brought into
bondage. <sup>20</sup>For if, having escaped the pollutions of the
world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christy
but having again become entangled therein they are overcome, the
last state is become worse with them than the first.
<sup>21</sup>For it were better for them not to have known the way
of righteousness, than, having known it, to turn back from the holy
commandment delivered to them. <sup>22</sup>But it has happened to
them according to the true proverb: <span class="ot">A dog,
returned to his own vomit;</span> and, <span class="ot">A sow that
was washed, to the wallowing in the mire.</span></p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

letter, beloved, I now write to you; in both which I stir up your
pure mind by putting you in remembrance; <sup>2</sup>that ye may be
mindful of the words spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the
commandment of the Lord and Savior by your apostles;
<sup>3</sup>knowing this first, that there shall come in the last
of the days scoffers, in their scoffings, walking after their own
lusts, <sup>4</sup>and saying: Where is the promise of his coming?
for from the day the fathers fell asleep, all things so continue,
from the beginning of the creation. <sup>5</sup>For of this they
willingly are ignorant, that by the word of God there were heavens
of old, and earth framed out of water and by means of water,
<sup>6</sup>whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with
water, perished; <sup>7</sup>but the heavens that now are, and the
earth, by his word are kept in store, being reserved for fire unto
the day of judgment and of perdition of ungodly men.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this
one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
thousand years as one day. <sup>9</sup>The Lord is not tardy in
respect to the promise, as some account tardiness; but is
long-suffering toward us<sup><a href="#r610309" id="f610309" title=
"see footnote" name="f610309">9</a></sup>, not wishing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
<sup>10</sup>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in which
the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, and the elements
will be dissolved with burning heat, and the earth and the works
therein will be burned up.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Seeing then that all these things are
dissolving, what manner of men ought ye to be, in all holy
deportment and godliness; <sup>12</sup>looking for and hastening
the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens being on
fire will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with burning
heat? <sup>13</sup>But, according to his promise, we look for new
heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look
for these things, be diligent that ye may be found without spot and
blameless in his sight, in peace. <sup>15</sup>And the
long-suffering of our Lord account salvation; as also our beloved
brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you;
<sup>16</sup>as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these
things; in which things are some that are hard to be understood,
which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as also the other
Scriptures, unto their own destruction.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know
beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the
lawless, ye fall from your own steadfastness. <sup>18</sup>But grow
in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To
him be the glory, both now and forever. Amen.</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">I.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;T<span class=

heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we looked
upon, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life;
<sup>2</sup>(and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and
bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with
the Father, and was manifested to us;) <sup>3</sup>that which we
have seen and have heard we report to you also, that ye also may
have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the
Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. <sup>4</sup>And these things
we write to you, that your joy may be full.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And this is the message which we have
heard from him, and announce to you, That God is light, and in him
there is no darkness.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>If we say that we have fellowship with
him, and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth;
<sup>7</sup>but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we
have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus
Christ<sup><a href="#r620107" id="f620107" title="see footnote"
name="f620107">7</a></sup> his Son cleanses us from all sin.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>If we say that we have not sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. <sup>9</sup>If we
confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, that he may forgive
us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
<sup>10</sup>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar,
and his word is not in us.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">II.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;M<span class="sc">y</span> little
children, these things I write to you, that ye may not sin. And if
any one have sinned, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous. <sup>2</sup>And he is a propitiation for our
sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And in this we know that we know him, if
we keep his commandments. <sup>4</sup>He that says, I know him, and
keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
<sup>5</sup>But whoever keeps his word, of a truth in him the love
of God is perfected. In this we know that we are in him.
<sup>6</sup>He that says he abides in him ought, as he walked,
himself also so to walk.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Beloved, I write not to you a new
commandment, but an old commandment which ye had from the
beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard from the
beginning<sup><a href="#r620207" id="f620207" title="see footnote"
name="f620207">7</a></sup>. <sup>8</sup>Again, a new commandment I
write to you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the
darkness is passing away, and the true light now shines.
<sup>9</sup>He that says he is in the light, and hates his brother,
is in the darkness until now. <sup>10</sup>He that loves his
brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling
in him. <sup>11</sup>But he that hates his brother is in the
darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes,
because the darkness blinded his eyes.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>I write to you, little children,
because your sins have been forgiven you for his name's sake.
<sup>13</sup>I write to you, fathers, because ye know him that was
from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have
overcome the evil one.</p>
<p class="pin">I wrote to you, little children, because ye know the
Father. <sup>14</sup>I wrote to you, fathers, because ye know him
that was from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because ye
are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome
the evil one.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Love not the world, neither the things
in the world. If any one loves the world, the love of the Father is
not in him. <sup>16</sup>Because all that is in the world, the lust
of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the empty pomp of life,
is not of the Father, but is of the world. <sup>17</sup>And the
world is passing away, and the lust thereof; but he that does the
will of God abides forever.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Little children, it is the last time;
and as ye heard that antichrist should come, even now many
antichrists have arisen; from whence we know that it is the last
time. <sup>19</sup>They went out from among us, but they were not
of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with
us; but it was in order that they might be made manifest, that all
are not of us.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>And ye have an anointing from the Holy
One, and know all things. <sup>21</sup>I wrote not to you because
ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and because no
lie is of the truth. <sup>22</sup>Who is the liar, but he that
denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, who denies
the Father and the Son. <sup>23</sup>Every one that denies the Son,
the same has not the Father; he that acknowledges the Son has also
the Father.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>What ye heard from the beginning, let
it abide in you. If what ye heard from the beginning shall abide in
you, ye also will abide in the Son, and in the Father.
<sup>25</sup>And this is the promise which he himself promised to
us, the life eternal.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>26</sup>These things I wrote to you concerning
those who seduce you. <sup>27</sup>And the anointing which ye
received from him abides in you, and ye have no need that any one
teach you; but, as the same anointing teaches you concerning all
things, and is truth, and is not a lie, and even as it taught you,
abide in him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>28</sup>And now, little children, abide in him;
that, if he should be manifested, we may have confidence, and not
turn away from him with shame at his coming. <sup>29</sup>If ye
know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that does
righteousness has been begotten of him.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">III.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class="sc">ehold</span> what
manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called
children of God. For this cause the world knows not us, because it
knew not him. <sup>2</sup>Beloved, now are we the children of God,
and it was never yet manifested what we shall be. We know that if
it shall be manifested, we shall be like him, because we shall see
him as he is. <sup>3</sup>And every one, that has this hope on him,
purifies himself even as he is pure. <sup>4</sup>Every one that
commits sin also commits transgression of law; and sin is
transgression of law. <sup>5</sup>And ye know that he was
manifested that he might take away our<sup><a href="#r620305" id=
"f620305" title="see footnote" name="f620305">5</a></sup> sins; and
in him is no sin. <sup>6</sup>Every one that abides in him sins
not; whoever sins has not seen him, neither has known him.
<sup>7</sup>Little children, let no one deceive you. He that does
righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. <sup>8</sup>He
that commits sin is of the Devil; because the Devil sins from the
beginning. To this end the Son of God was manifested, that he might
destroy the works of the Devil. <sup>9</sup>Whoever has been
begotten of God does not commit sin; because his seed abides in
him; and he can not sin, because he has been begotten of God.
<sup>10</sup>In this are manifest the children of God, and the
children of the Devil. Every one that does not righteousness is not
of God, neither he that loves not his brother; <sup>11</sup>because
this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
should love one another <sup>12</sup>Not as Cain was of the evil
one, and slew his brother. And wherefore did he slay him? Because
his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
<sup>13</sup>Wonder not, brethren, if the world hates you.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>We know that we have passed out of
death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loves not
his brother<sup><a href="#r620314" id="f620314" title=
"see footnote" name="f620314">14</a></sup> abides in death.
<sup>15</sup>Every one that hates his brother is a
murderer<sup><a href="#r620315" id="f620315" title="see footnote"
name="f620315">15</a></sup>; and ye know that no murderer has
eternal life abiding in him. <sup>16</sup>In this we know love,
that he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our
lives for the brethren. <sup>17</sup>But whoever has the world's
sustenance, and sees his brother having need, and shuts up his pity
from him, how abides the love of God in him?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Little children, let us not love in
word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. <sup>19</sup>And
in this we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall assure
our hearts before him. <sup>20</sup>Because if our heart accuse us,
God is greater than our heart, and knows all things<sup><a href=
"#r620320" id="f620320" title="see footnote" name=
"f620320">20</a></sup>. <sup>21</sup>Beloved, if our heart accuse
us not, we have confidence toward God. <sup>22</sup>And whatever we
ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do
the things that are pleasing in his sight. <sup>23</sup>And this is
his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son
Jesus Christ, and should love one another, as he gave us
commandment. <sup>24</sup>And he that keeps his commandments abides
in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abides in us,
from the Spirit which he gave us.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IV.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;B<span class="sc">eloved</span>,
believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of
God; because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.
<sup>2</sup>In this ye know the Spirit of God: <sup>3</sup>Every
spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is
of God; and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus, is not of
God; and this is that of the antichrist, of which ye have heard
that it should come; and now, it is already in the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>Ye are of God, little children, and have
overcome them; because greater is he who is in you, than he who is
in the world. <sup>5</sup>They are of the world; for this cause
they speak of the world, and the world hears them. <sup>6</sup>We
are of God; he that knows God, hears us; he that is not of God,
hears us not. From this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit
of error.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>Beloved, let us love one another;
because love is of God, and every one that loves has been begotten
of God, and knows God. <sup>8</sup>He that loves not, knew not God;
because God is love. <sup>9</sup>In this was manifested the love of
God in respect to us, that God has sent his only begotten Son into
the world, that we might live through him. <sup>10</sup>Herein is
love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his
Son, a propitiation for our sins.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also
ought to love one another. <sup>12</sup>No man has ever seen God.
If we love one another, God abides in us, and the love of him is
perfected in us. <sup>13</sup>In this we know that we abide in him,
and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
<sup>14</sup>And we have seen, and bear witness, that the Father
has sent forth the Son, a Savior of the world. <sup>15</sup>Whoever
acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and
he in God. <sup>16</sup>And we have known, and have believed, the
love that God has in respect to us. God is love; and he that abides
in love abides in God, and God in him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>In this has love been perfected with
us<sup><a href="#r620417" id="f620417" title="see footnote" name=
"f620417">17</a></sup>, that we have confidence in the day of
judgment; because as he is, we also are in this world.
<sup>18</sup>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out
fear, because fear has torment<sup><a href="#r620418" id="f620418"
title="see footnote" name="f620418">18</a></sup>; and he that fears
is not made perfect in love. <sup>19</sup>We love, because he first
loved us. <sup>20</sup>If any one say, I love God, and hates his
brother, he is a liar; for he that loves not his brother whom he
has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
<sup>21</sup>And this commandment we have from him, that he who
loves God love also his brother.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;E<span class=
"sc">very</span> one who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been
begotten of God; and every one that loves him who begot, loves also
him that has been begotten of him. <sup>2</sup>In this we know that
we love the children of God, when we love God, and do his
commandments. <sup>3</sup>For this is the love of God, that we keep
his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome;
<sup>4</sup>because all that is begotten of God overcomes the
world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.
<sup>5</sup>Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that
believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>This is he who came by water and blood,
Jesus the Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in
the blood. And the Spirit is that which bears witness, because the
Spirit is the truth. <sup>7</sup>For there are three who bear
witness; the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; <sup>8</sup>and
the three agree in the one<sup><a href="#r620508" id="f620508"
title="see footnote" name="f620508">8</a></sup>. <sup>9</sup>If we
receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this
is the witness of God, that he has borne witness concerning his
Son. <sup>10</sup>He that believes on the Son of God has the
witness in himself; he that believes not God has made him a liar;
because he has not believed in the witness which God has borne
concerning his Son. <sup>11</sup>And this is the witness, that God
gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
<sup>12</sup>He that has the Son has the life; he that has not the
Son of God has not the life.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>These things I wrote to you, that ye
may know that ye have eternal life, who believe on the name of the
Son of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And this is the confidence that we have
toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he
hears us. <sup>15</sup>And if we know that he hears us, whatever we
ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of
him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>If any one see his brother sin a sin
not unto death, he shall ask, and he will give him life,&mdash;to
those who sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death; for that I
do not say that he shall pray.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>All unrighteousness is sin; and there
is a sin not unto death.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>We know that every one who has been
begotten of God sins not; but he that was begotten of God keeps
himself; and the evil one touches him not.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>We know that we are of God, and the
whole world is lying in the evil one. <sup>20</sup>And we know that
the Son of God is come, and has given us understanding, that we may
know the True one; and we are in the True One, in his Son Jesus
Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.</p>

<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>Beloved, while giving all diligence to
write to you concerning the common salvation, I found it needful
for me to write to you exhorting to contend earnestly for the
faith, delivered once for all to the saints. <sup>4</sup>For there
crept in stealthily certain men, who of old were appointed
beforehand to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of
our God into wantonness, and denying the only Master, and our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>But I wish to remind you, as once
knowing all, that Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of
Egypt, afterward destroyed those who believed not. <sup>6</sup>And
angels who kept not their principality, but left their own
habitation, he has kept in everlasting chains under darkness, unto
the judgment of the great day. <sup>7</sup>As Sodom and Gomorrah,

themselves over to fornication, and going away after other flesh,
are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
fire.</p>

bring against him a railing judgment, but said: The Lord rebuke
thee. <sup>10</sup>But these rail at the things which they know
not; but what things naturally, as the brute beasts, they
understand, in these they corrupt themselves.</p>

of Cain, and rushed on in the error of Balaam for reward, and

<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>These are rocks in your feasts of love,
feasting with you fearlessly, feeding their own selves; clouds
without water, carried away by winds; autumnal trees, without
fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; <sup>13</sup>raging
waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for
whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>Yea, and of these Enoch the seventh
from Adam prophesied, saying: Behold, the Lord came, with his holy
myriads. <sup>15</sup>to execute judgment upon all, and to convict
all the ungodly among them of all their acts of ungodliness which
they committed, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners
spoke against him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>These are murmurers, complaining of
their lot, walking according to their lusts; and their mouth speaks
swelling words; having respect to persons, for the sake of
profit.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>But ye, beloved, remember the words
which were before spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
<sup>18</sup>that they told you, that at the last of the time there
will be scoffers, walking after their own lusts of ungodliness.
<sup>19</sup>These are they who separate; sensual, having not the
Spirit. <sup>20</sup>But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on
your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, <sup>21</sup>keep
yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord
Jesus Christ, unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And some refute when they are
contending; but others save, snatching them out of the fire;
<sup>23</sup>and others compassionate with fear, hating even the
garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>Now to him who is able to keep you from
falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his
glory with exceeding joy; <sup>25</sup>to the only God our Savior,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and
power, before all time, and now, and forever. Amen.</p>

the seven churches; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamus, and
to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to

<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And I turned to see the voice that was

lamp-stands; <sup>13</sup>and in the midst of the lamp-stands one
like to the Son of Man, clothed with a garment falling down to the
feet, and girded round at the breasts with a golden girdle.
<sup>14</sup>But his head and his hairs were white, as white wool,

waters. <sup>16</sup>And he had in his hand seven stars; and out of
his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet
as dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying: Fear not: I am
the first and the last, <sup>18</sup>and the living one; and I

of death and of the underworld. <sup>19</sup>Write therefore the
things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things
which shall be after these; <sup>20</sup>the mystery of the seven
stars which thou sawest on my right hand, and the seven golden

those who say they are apostles, and are not, and didst find them
liars; <sup>3</sup>and thou hast patience, and didst bear for my

<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>But I have this against thee, that thou
hast left thy first love. <sup>5</sup>Remember therefore from
whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; but if
not, I am coming to thee, and will remove thy lamp-stand out of its
place, if thou repent not.</p>

<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>But I have a few things against thee.
Thou hast there men holding the teaching of Balaam, who taught
Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat
things offered to idols, and to commit fornication.

Nicolaitans, in like manner. <sup>16</sup>Repent therefore; but if
not, I come to thee quickly, and will make war with them, with the
sword of my mouth.</p>

he that receives it.</p>

a prophetess; and she teaches and seduces my servants to commit
fornication, and to eat things offered to idols. <sup>21</sup>And I

fornication. <sup>22</sup>Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those

saying: Come up hither, and I will show thee what things must take
place after these.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>Immediately I was in the Spirit; and,
behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
<sup>3</sup>And he who sat was like in appearance to a jasper and
sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round the throne, like in
appearance to an emerald; <sup>4</sup>and around the throne were
twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones twenty-four elders
sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads crowns of
gold. <sup>5</sup>And out of the throne proceed lightnings, and
voices, and thunders; and there were seven lamps of fire burning
before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;
<sup>6</sup>and before the throne as it were a sea of glass like to
crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and around the throne,
four animals full of eyes before and behind. <sup>7</sup>And the
first animal was like to a lion, and the second animal like to a
calf, and the third animal having its face as of a man, and the
fourth animal like to an eagle flying. <sup>8</sup>And the four
animals had each of them six wings apiece; around and within they
are full of eyes; and they have no rest by day and by night,
saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was, and who
is, and who is to come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And when the animals shall give glory,
and honor, and thanksgiving, to him who sits upon the throne, to
him who lives forever and ever, <sup>10</sup>the twenty-four elders
will fall down before him who sits upon the throne, and will
worship him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns
before the throne, saying: <sup>11</sup>Worthy art thou, our Lord
and our God, to receive the glory, and the honor, and the power;
because thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they
were, and were created.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">V.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=

seals?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And no one was able, in heaven, nor on
the earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look
thereon. <sup>4</sup>And I wept much, because no one was found
worthy to open the book, nor to look thereon.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And one of the elders says to me: Weep
not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of
David, prevailed to open the book, and its seven seals.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And I saw, in the midst of the throne
and of the four animals, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb
standing, as if having been slain, having seven horns and seven
eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the
earth. <sup>7</sup>And he came, and has taken the book out of the
right hand of him who sits upon the throne.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And when he took the book, the four
animals, and the twenty-four elders, fell down before the Lamb,
having each one a harp, and golden cups full of odors, which are
the prayers of saints. <sup>9</sup>And they sing a new song,
saying: Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals;
because thou wast slain, and didst redeem to God by thy blood out
of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;
<sup>10</sup>and didst make them unto our God<sup><a href=

Lamb that has been slain, to receive the power, and riches, and
wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
<sup>13</sup>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the
earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that are in

crown was given to him; and he went forth conquering, and to
conquer.</p>

heard the second animal saying: Come! <sup>4</sup>And there went
forth another horse that was red. And to him who sat thereon it was
given to take away peace from the earth, and that they should slay
one another; and there was given to him a great sword.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And when he opened the third seal, I
heard the third animal saying: Come! And I saw, and behold a black
horse, and he who sat on him having a balance in his hand.
<sup>6</sup>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals,
saying: A quart of wheat<sup><a href="#r660606" id="f660606" title=

three quarts of barley for a den&aacute;ry; and: Hurt not the oil

heard the voice of the fourth animal saying: Come! <sup>8</sup>And
I saw, and behold a pale horse; and he who sat on him, his name was
Death, and the underworld followed with him. And authority was
given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with
sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the beasts of the
earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw
under the altar the souls of those slain on account of the word of
God, and on account of the testimony which they had.

Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
on those who dwell upon the earth? <sup>11</sup>And a white robe
was given to each one of them; and it was said to them, that they
should rest yet a little time, until also their fellow-servants and
their brethren, who are about to be killed as they were, should be
fully numbered.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And I saw when he opened the sixth
seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as
sackcloth of hair, and the moon became all as blood;
<sup>13</sup>and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a
fig-tree casts its untimely figs, when shaken by a great wind;
<sup>14</sup>and the heaven parted asunder as a scroll rolled
together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their
places. <sup>15</sup>And the kings of the earth, and the great men,
and the chief captains, and the rich men, and the strong men, and
every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the
rocks of the mountains; <sup>16</sup>and they say to the mountains
and to the rocks: Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him
who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;

able to stand?</p>

holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on
the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And I saw another angel coming up from
the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he
cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to
hurt the earth and the sea, <sup>3</sup>saying: Hurt not the earth,
nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our
God upon their foreheads.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And I heard the number of the sealed. A
hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed, out of every tribe of
the sons of Israel. <sup>5</sup>out of the tribe of Judah were
sealed twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve
thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand; <sup>6</sup>out
of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of

Issachar, twelve thousand; <sup>8</sup>out of the tribe of Zebulun,
twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; out
of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand, were sealed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>After these things I saw, and behold a
great multitude, which no one could number, out of every nation and
all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne, and
before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands.

our God, who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb.
<sup>11</sup>And all the angels were standing round the throne and
the elders and the four animals, and fell before the throne on
their faces, and worshiped God, <sup>12</sup>saying: Amen; the
blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and
the honor, and the power, and the might, be to our God forever and
ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And one of the elders answered, saying
to me: These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and
whence came they? <sup>14</sup>And I said to him: Sir, thou
knowest. And he said to me: These are they who come out of the
great affliction, and they washed their robes, and made them white
in the blood of the Lamb. <sup>15</sup>Therefore are they before
the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple;
and he who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over
them<sup><a href="#r660715" id="f660715" title="see footnote" name=

neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor
any heat; <sup>17</sup>because the Lamb which is in the midst of
the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to the
fountains of the waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear
from their eyes.</p>

smoke of the incense to the prayers of the saints, out of the hand
of the angel, before God.</p>

mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice: Woe, woe, woe, to those who
dwell upon the earth, by reason of the remaining voices of the
trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">IX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> the fifth
angel sounded; and I saw a star fallen out of heaven to the earth,
and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.
<sup>2</sup>And he opened the pit of the abyss, and there went up a
smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun
and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
<sup>3</sup>And out of the smoke went forth locusts into the earth;
and there was given to them power, as the scorpions of the earth
have power. <sup>4</sup>And it was said to them, that they should
not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree,
but only the men who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads.
<sup>5</sup>And it was given to them, that they should not kill
them, but that they shall be tormented five months. And their
torment is as the torment of a scorpion, when it has smitten a
man.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And in those days men will seek death,
and shall not find it; and they will desire to die, and death flees
from them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And the shapes of the locusts were like
to horses prepared for battle; and on their heads were as it were
crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.
<sup>8</sup>And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth
were as the teeth of lions. <sup>9</sup>And they had breastplates,
as breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the
sound of chariots of many horses running into battle.
<sup>10</sup>And they have tails like to scorpions, and stings; and
in their tails is their power to hurt men, five months.
<sup>11</sup>They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss.
His name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon; but in the Greek tongue
he has for a name, Apollyon.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>The first woe is past; behold, there
come yet two woes, after these things.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And the sixth angel sounded; and I
heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is
before God, <sup>14</sup>saying to the sixth angel who had the
trumpet: Loose the four angels who are bound, by the great river
Euphrates. <sup>15</sup>And the four angels were loosed, who had
been prepared for the hour, and day, and month, and year, that they
may slay the third part of men. <sup>16</sup>And the number of the
armies of the horsemen was two hundred thousand thousand. I heard
the number of them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And thus I saw the horses in the
vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and
of hyacinth, and like brimstone; and the heads of the horses were
as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths issue fire, and
smoke, and brimstone. <sup>18</sup>By these three plagues was the
third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the
brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. <sup>19</sup>For the
power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails; for
their tails are like to serpents, having heads, and with them they
do hurt. <sup>20</sup>And the rest of men, who were not killed in
these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they
should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of
brass, and of stone, and of wood, which can neither see, nor hear,
nor walk; <sup>21</sup>and they repented not of their murders, nor
of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their
thefts.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class="dc2">X.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class=
"sc">nd</span> I saw another strong angel coming down out of
heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow was upon his head,
and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.
<sup>2</sup>And he had in his hand a little book opened. And he set
his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land;
<sup>3</sup>and he cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars; and
when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
<sup>4</sup>And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to
write; and I heard a voice out of heaven saying to me: Seal up the
things which the seven thunders spoke, and write them not.
<sup>5</sup>And the angel, whom I saw standing upon the sea and
upon the land, lifted up his right hand to heaven, <sup>6</sup>and
swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the
things therein, and the earth and the things therein, and the sea
and the things therein, that there shall be time<sup><a href=
"#r661006" id="f661006" title="see footnote" name=
"f661006">6</a></sup> no longer; <sup>7</sup>but in the days of the
voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is the
mystery of God finished, as he gave the joyful message to his
servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And the voice which I heard out of
heaven [I heard] again speaking to me, and saying: Go, take the
little book which lies opened in the hand of the angel, who stands
upon the sea and upon the land. <sup>9</sup>And I went to the
angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he said to me:
Take, and eat it up; and it will make thy belly bitter, but in thy
mouth it will be sweet as honey.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And I took the little book out of the
hand of the angel, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth as honey,
sweet; and when I had eaten it, my belly became bitter.
<sup>11</sup>And they say to me: Thou must again prophesy of many
peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> there was
given me a reed, like to a staff, saying: Rise, and measure the
temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship therein.
<sup>2</sup>And the court which is without the temple leave out,
and measure it not; because it was given to the Gentiles, and they
will tread down the holy city forty-two months. <sup>3</sup>And I
will give [power] to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a
thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>These are the two olive-trees, and the
two lamp-stands, which stand before the Lord of the earth.
<sup>5</sup>And if any one desires to hurt them, fire goes forth
out of their mouth, and devours their enemies; and if any one
desires to hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>These have power to shut heaven, that it
rain not in the days of their prophecy; and have power over the
waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with every
plague, as often as they will.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And when they shall have finished their
testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war
with them, and will overcome them, and will kill them.
<sup>8</sup>And their remains are on the street of the great city,
which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord also
was crucified. <sup>9</sup>And some out of the peoples, and tribes,
and tongues, and nations, look on their remains three days and a
half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be put into a tomb.
<sup>10</sup>And they who dwell on the earth rejoice ever them, and
are glad; and they will send gifts to one another, because these
two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And after three days and a half, the
spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon
their feet; and great fear fell upon those who beheld them.
<sup>12</sup>And they heard a loud voice out of heaven, saying to
them: Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud,
and their enemies beheld them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And in that hour there was a great
earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and in the
earthquake were slain of men seven thousand names; and the rest
became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>The second woe is past; behold, the
third woe comes quickly.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And the seventh angel sounded; and
there followed loud voices in heaven, saying: The kingdom of the
world is become our Lord's, and his Christ's; and he will reign
forever and ever. <sup>16</sup>And the twenty-four elders, who sit
before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshiped
God, <sup>17</sup>saying: We give thanks to thee, O Lord God the
Almighty, who art, and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great
power, and didst reign. <sup>18</sup>And the nations were enraged,
and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to
give the reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints,
and to those who fear thy name, the small and the great; and to
destroy those who destroy the earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And the temple of God was opened in
heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple; and
there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake,
and a great hail.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> a great
sign was seen in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon
under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
<sup>2</sup>And being with child she cries out, travailing in
birth, and pained to be delivered.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And another sign was seen in heaven; and
behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on
his heads seven crowns. <sup>4</sup>And his tail drags the third
part of the stars of heaven; and it cast them to the earth.</p>
<p class="pin">And the dragon stands before the woman who was about
to bring forth, that when she has brought forth, he may devour her
child. <sup>5</sup>And she brought forth a man-child, who will rule
all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God,
and to his throne. <sup>6</sup>And the woman fled into the
wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they may
nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And there was war in heaven, Michael and
his angels fighting with the dragon. And the dragon fought, and his
angels, <sup>8</sup>and prevailed not; neither was their place
found any more in heaven.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And the great dragon was cast down, the
old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, who leads astray the whole
world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down
with him.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And I heard a loud voice in heaven,
saying: Now is come the salvation, and the strength, and the
kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; because the
accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our
God day and night. <sup>11</sup>And they overcame him, because of
the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony;
and they loved not their life, unto the death. <sup>12</sup>For
this cause rejoice, ye heavens, and they who dwell in them. Woe to
the earth and the sea! For the Devil is come down to you, having
great wrath, knowing that he has little time.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And when the dragon saw that he was
cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth
the man-child. <sup>14</sup>And there were given to the woman the
two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the
wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and
times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And the serpent cast out of his mouth
water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be
carried away by the flood. <sup>16</sup>And the earth helped the
woman; and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood
which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And the dragon was enraged at the
woman; and he departed to make war with the rest of her seed, who
keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus.</p>

stood<sup><a href="#r661301a" id="f661301a" title="see footnote"

beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads,
and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads names of
blasphemy<sup><a href="#r661301b" id="f661301b" title=

beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet as of a bear,
and his mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave to him
his power, and his throne, and great authority;) <sup>3</sup>and
one of his heads as it were wounded unto death. And his deadly
wound was healed; and all the world wondered after the beast.
<sup>4</sup>And they worshiped the dragon, because he gave the
authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying: Who
is like to the beast, and who is able to make war with him?</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And there was given to him a mouth
speaking great and blasphemous things; and power was given him to
work forty-two months. <sup>6</sup>And he opened his mouth in
blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle,
those who tabernacle in heaven. <sup>7</sup>And it was given him to
make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given
him over every tribe, and tongue, and nation. <sup>8</sup>And all
who dwell upon the earth will worship him, whose names are not
written in the book of life of the Lamb which is slain, from the
foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>If any one has an ear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>If any one is for captivity, he goes
into captivity; if any to be killed with the sword, he must be

saints.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And I saw another beast coming up out
of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a
dragon. <sup>12</sup>And he exercises all the authority of the
first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who
dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was
healed. <sup>13</sup>And he does great signs, so that also he
causes fire to come down out of heaven on the earth, in the sight
of men; <sup>14</sup>and he leads astray those who dwell on the
earth, because of the signs which it was given him to do in the
presence of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that
they should make an image to the beast, which has the wound of the
sword, and lived. <sup>15</sup>And it was given him to give
breath<sup><a href="#r661315" id="f661315" title="see footnote"

image of the beast should also speak, and should cause that as many

that has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his
name.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>Here is wisdom. Let him that has
understanding count up the number of the beast, for it is the
number of a man; and his number is Six hundred and sixty-six.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

behold, the Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred
and forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his
Father written on their foreheads.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And I heard a voice out of heaven, as
the voice of many waters, and as the voice of loud thunder; the
voice which I heard was as that of harpers, harping with their
harps. <sup>3</sup>And they sing as it were a new song before the
throne, and before the four animals and the elders; and no one was
able to learn the song, except the hundred and forty-four thousand,
who are redeemed from the earth. <sup>4</sup>These are they who
were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they
who follow the Lamb, whithersoever he goes. These were redeemed
from men, a first-fruits to God and to the Lamb. <sup>5</sup>And in
their mouth was found no falsehood; for they are blameless.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And I saw another angel flying in
mid-heaven, having the everlasting gospel<sup><a href="#r661406"

preach to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and

voice: Fear God, and give glory to him, because the hour of his
judgment is come; and worship him who made heaven and earth, and
sea, and fountains of waters.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And another, a second angel followed,
saying: Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, because she has
made all the nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And another, a third angel followed
them, saying with a loud voice: If any one worships the beast and
his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,
<sup>10</sup>he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his wrath, and
shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of holy
angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. <sup>11</sup>And the smoke
of their torment goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest
day and night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his name.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Here is the patience of the saints, who
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>13</sup>And I heard a voice out of heaven
saying: Write, Happy are the dead who die in the Lord, henceforth;
yea, says the Spirit, that they shall rest from their labors, for
their works follow with them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And I saw, and behold a white cloud,
and upon the cloud one sitting like to the Son of man, having on
his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
<sup>15</sup>And another angel came forth out of the temple, crying
with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud: Put forth thy
sickle, and reap; because the time to reap is come; because the
harvest of the earth is ripe. <sup>16</sup>And he who sat on the
cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was
reaped.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And another angel came forth out of the
temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
<sup>18</sup>And another angel came out from the altar, who had
power over fire; and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the
sharp sickle, saying: Put forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the
clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
<sup>19</sup>And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and
gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great
wine-press of the wrath of God. <sup>20</sup>And the wine-press was
trodden without the city, and blood came forth out of the
wine-press, even to the bits of the horses, as far as a thousand
and six hundred furlongs.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having
seven plagues; which are the last, because in them is completed the
wrath of God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And I saw as it were a sea of glass,
mingled with fire; and those who had gained the victory over the
beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name,
standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God. <sup>3</sup>And
they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the
Lamb, saying: Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God the
Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of the nations.
<sup>4</sup>Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name?
Because thou alone art holy; because all the nations shall come and
worship before thee; because thy judgments are made manifest.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And after these things I saw, and the
temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened;
<sup>6</sup>and there came forth the seven angels having the seven
plagues, clothed in pure, shining linen, and girded about the
breasts with golden girdles. <sup>7</sup>And one of the four
animals gave to the seven angels seven golden cups, full of the
wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. <sup>8</sup>And the
temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his
power; and no one was able to enter into the temple, till the seven
plagues of the seven angels should be completed.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=

loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels: Go, and
pour out the seven cups of the wrath of God into the earth.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And the first departed, and poured out
his cup into the earth<sup><a href="#r661602" id="f661602" title=

and grievous sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast, and
who worship his image.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>3</sup>And the second poured out his cup into
the sea; and it became blood, as of a dead man; and every living
thing died that was in the sea.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And the third poured out his cup into
the rivers, and the fountains of water; and they became blood.
<sup>5</sup>And I heard the angel of the waters saying: Righteous
art thou, who art and who wast holy, because thou didst thus judge;
<sup>6</sup>because they shed the blood of saints and prophets, and
thou hast given them blood to drink. They are worthy.
<sup>7</sup>And I heard, out of the altar, one saying<sup><a href=
"#r661607" id="f661607" title="see footnote" name=

righteous are thy judgments.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And the fourth poured out his cup upon
the sun; and it was given to it to scorch men with fire.
<sup>9</sup>And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed
the name of God, who has the power over these plagues, and repented
not, to give him glory.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And the fifth poured out his cup upon
the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they
gnawed their tongues for pain, <sup>11</sup>and blasphemed the God
of heaven, because of their pains and their sores, and repented not
of their works.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And the sixth poured out his cup upon
the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that
the way of the kings, who are from the rising of the sun, might be
prepared. <sup>13</sup>And I saw come out of the mouth of the
dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of
the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs; <sup>14</sup>for
they are spirits of demons, working signs, which go forth over the
kings of the whole habitable world, to gather them to the battle of
that great day of God the Almighty.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>Behold, I come as a thief. Happy is he
that watches, and keeps his garments, that he may not walk naked
and they see his shame.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>And they gathered them into the place
called in the Hebrew tongue, Armageddon.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And the seventh poured out his cup upon
the air; and there came forth a loud voice out of the temple of
heaven, from the throne, saying: It is done. <sup>18</sup>And there
were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great
earthquake, such as was not since there was a man upon the earth,
so mighty an earthquake, so great. <sup>19</sup>And the great city
was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell;
and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the
cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. <sup>20</sup>And
every island fled away, and mountains were not found.
<sup>21</sup>And great hail, as of a talent's weight, comes down
out of heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God on account of the
plague of the hail; because the plague thereof was exceeding
great.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XVII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> there
came one of the seven angels who have the seven cups, and talked
with me, saying: Come hither; I will show thee the judgment of the
great harlot, that sits upon many waters; <sup>2</sup>with whom the
kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of
the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
<sup>3</sup>And he carried me away in the spirit into the
wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of
the names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
<sup>4</sup>And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and
gilded with gold, and precious stones and pearls, having a golden
cup in her hand, full of abominations and the impurities of her
fornication. <sup>5</sup>And upon her forehead was a name written:
MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And I saw the woman drunken with the
blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus;
and I wondered when I saw her, with great wonder. <sup>7</sup>And
the angel said to me: Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee
the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which
has the seven heads and the ten horns. <sup>8</sup>The beast that
thou sawest was, and is not, and is to come up out of the abyss,
and to go into perdition; and they will wonder who dwell on the
earth, whose names are not written in the book of life from the
foundation of the world, seeing the beast, that he was, and is not,
and shall come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>Here is the mind that has wisdom. The
seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.
<sup>10</sup>And they are seven kings; the five are fallen, and the
one is; the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must
remain a little time. <sup>11</sup>And the beast that was, and is
not, he also is an eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into
perdition.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And the ten horns which thou sawest are
ten kings, who received no kingdom as yet; but receive authority as
kings one hour, along with the beast. <sup>13</sup>These have one
mind, and give their power and authority to the beast.
<sup>14</sup>These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will
overcome them; because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and
they who are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And he says to me: The waters which
thou sawest, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes, and
nations and tongues. <sup>16</sup>And the ten horns, and the beast,
these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked,
and will eat her flesh, and will burn her up with fire.
<sup>17</sup>For God put it into their hearts to do his will, and
to form one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until
the words of God shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>And the woman which thou sawest is the
great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.</p>

authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
<sup>2</sup>And he cried with a strong voice, saying: Babylon the
great is fallen, is fallen, and is become a habitation of demons,
and a hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and
hateful bird. <sup>3</sup>Because all the nations have drunk of the
wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth
committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth
became rich out of the abundance of her luxury.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And I heard another voice out of heaven,
saying: Come out of her, my people, that ye partake not in her
sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. <sup>5</sup>For her
sins reached unto heaven, and God remembered her iniquities.
<sup>6</sup>Reward her as she also rewarded, and render twofold
according to her works; in the cup which she mixed, mix for her
twofold. <sup>7</sup>By as much as she glorified herself, and lived
luxuriously, so much torment and mourning give her; because in her
heart she says: I sit a queen, and not a widow, and shall not see
mourning. <sup>8</sup>Therefore shall her plagues come in one day,
death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be burned up with
fire because strong is the Lord God who judged her.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And the kings of the earth, who
committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her, shall weep,
and shall lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning;
<sup>10</sup>standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying:
Alas, alas, the great city Babylon, the mighty city! Because in one
hour thy judgment is come.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And the merchants of the earth shall
weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their lading any more;
<sup>12</sup>the lading of gold, and of silver, and of precious
stones, and of pearls, and of fine linen, and of purple, and of
silk, and of scarlet; and all citron wood, and every vessel of
ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and of brass, and of
iron and of marble, <sup>13</sup>and cinnamon, and amomum, and
odors, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine
flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and [lading] of horses,
and of chariots, and of slaves; and souls of men. <sup>14</sup>And
the fruit that thy soul desired departed from thee, and all the
dainty and goodly things perished from thee, and thou shalt no more
find them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>The merchants of these things, who
became rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her
torment, weeping and mourning, <sup>16</sup>saying: Alas, alas, the
great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and
scarlet, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearls;
<sup>17</sup>because in one hour so great riches are made
desolate.</p>
<p class="pin">And every pilot, and every one that sails to any
place, and seamen, and as many as do business at sea, stood afar
off, <sup>18</sup>and cried out when they saw the smoke of her
burning, saying: Who is like to the great city! <sup>19</sup>And
they cast dust upon their heads, and cried out, weeping and
mourning, saying: Alas, alas, the great city, whereby all that have
the ships in the sea became rich by reason of her costliness;
because in one hour she is made desolate.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye
saints, ye apostles, and ye prophets; because God judged your cause
upon her.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>And a strong angel took up a stone like
a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying: Thus with
violence shall Babylon the great city be cast down, and shall be
found no more. <sup>22</sup>And the voice of harpers, and of
musicians, and of pipers, and of trumpeters, shall be heard in thee
no more; and no craftsman, of whatever craft, shall be found any
more in thee, and the sound of a millstone shall be heard in thee
no more; <sup>23</sup>and the light of a lamp shall shine in thee
no more; and the voice of bridegroom and of bride shall be heard in
thee no more; because thy merchants were the great men of the
earth; because by thy sorcery all the nations were led astray.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>24</sup>And in her was found the blood of
prophets, and of saints and of all that have been slain upon the
earth.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XIX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">fter</span> these
things, I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in
heaven, of those saying: Alleluia; the salvation, and the glory,
and the power, are our God's; <sup>2</sup>because true and
righteous are his judgments; because he judged the great harlot,
who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and avenged the blood
of his servants at her hand. <sup>3</sup>And a second time they
said: Alleluia. And her smoke goes up forever and ever.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And the twenty-four elders, and the four
animals, fell down and worshiped God, who sits on the throne,
saying: Amen; Alleluia.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And a voice came out from the throne,
saying: Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye who fear him,
the small and the great.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And I heard as it were the voice of a
great multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound
of mighty thunders, saying: Alleluia; because the Lord God the
Almighty reigns. <sup>7</sup>Let us rejoice and exult, and we will
give to him the glory; because the marriage of the Lamb is come,
and his wife made herself ready. <sup>8</sup>And it was given her
that she should be clothed in fine linen, pure and shining; for the
fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And he says to me: Write, Happy are they
who are called to the marriage-supper of the Lamb. And he says to
me: These are the true sayings of God. <sup>10</sup>And I fell
before his feet to worship him. And he said to me: See thou do it
not. I am a fellow-servant of thee and of thy brethren who have the
testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a
white horse, and he who sat upon him, called Faithful and True; and
in righteousness he judges, and makes war. <sup>12</sup>His eyes
were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he
had a name written, which no one knows but he himself.
<sup>13</sup>And he was clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and
his name is called, The Word of God. <sup>14</sup>And the armies
which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine
linen, white, pure. <sup>15</sup>And out of his mouth goes a sharp
sword, that with it he may smite the nations; and he will rule them
with a rod of iron; and he treads the wine-press of the fierceness
of the wrath of God the Almighty. <sup>16</sup>And he has on his
garment, and on his thigh, a name written: KING OF KINGS, AND LORD
OF LORDS.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And I saw an angel standing in the sun.
And he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in
mid-heaven: Come, and gather yourselves together to the great
supper of God; <sup>18</sup>that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and
the flesh of captains of thousands, and the flesh of mighty men,
and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh
of all, both free and bond, both small and great.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>19</sup>And I saw the beast, and the kings of
the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war with him
who sat on the horse, and with his army. <sup>20</sup>And the beast
was seized, and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs
in his presence, with which he led astray those who received the
mark of the beast, and who warship his image. The two were cast
alive into the lake of fire, that burns with brimstone.
<sup>21</sup>And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat
upon the horse, which went forth out of his mouth; and all the
birds were filled with their flesh.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XX.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> I saw an
angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a
great chain in his hand. <sup>2</sup>And he laid hold of the
dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound
him a thousand years, <sup>3</sup>and cast him into the abyss, and
shut it, and set a seal over him, that he mislead the nations no
more, until the thousand years are finished; after these he must be
loosed a little time.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>4</sup>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon
them, and judgment was given to them; and the souls of those
beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of
the word of God, and whoever did not worship the beast, neither his
image, and did not receive the mark upon the forehead, or upon
their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
years. <sup>5</sup>The rest of the dead lived not until the
thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
<sup>6</sup>Happy and holy is he that has part in the first
resurrection; on these the second death has no power, but they
shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a
thousand years.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>7</sup>And when the thousand years are
finished, Satan will be loosed out of his prison, <sup>8</sup>and
will go out to mislead the nations that are in the four corners of
the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war, the
number of whom is as the sand of the sea. <sup>9</sup>And they went
up upon the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the
saints, and the beloved city; and fire came down from
God<sup><a href="#r662009" id="f662009" title="see footnote" name=
"f662009">9</a></sup> out of heaven, and devoured them.
<sup>10</sup>And the Devil who misleads them was cast into the lake
of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false
prophet; and they will be tormented day and night forever and
ever.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>11</sup>And I saw a great white throne, and him
who sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled
away, and no place was found for them.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>And I saw the dead, the great and the
small, standing before the throne. And books were opened; and
another book was opened, which is [the book] of life; and the dead
were judged out of the things written in the books, according to
their works. <sup>13</sup>And the sea gave up the dead which were
in it; and death and the underworld gave up the dead which were in
them; and they were judged each one according to their works.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>14</sup>And death and the underworld were cast
into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
<sup>15</sup>And if any one was not found written in the book of
life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXI.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> I saw a
new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first
earth passed away, and the sea is no more.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>2</sup>And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for
her husband. <sup>3</sup>And I heard a loud voice out of the
throne, saying: Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he
will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and
GOD-WITH-THEM<sup><a href="#r662103" id="f662103" title=
"see footnote" name="f662103">3</a></sup> himself will be their
God. <sup>4</sup>And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes;
and death shall be no more, nor shall mourning, nor crying, nor
pain be any more; because the former things are passed away.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>5</sup>And he who sat upon the throne said:
Behold, I make all things new. And he says: Write; because these
words are faithful and true.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And he said to me: It is done. I am the
Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him
that thirsts, of the fountain of the water of life freely.
<sup>7</sup>He that overcomes shall inherit these things; and I
will be to him a God, and he shall be to me a son. <sup>8</sup>But
the fearful, and unbelieving, and defiled with abominations, and
murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all
the liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire
and brimstone, which is the second death.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>9</sup>And there came one from among the seven
angels, who have the seven cups full of the seven last plagues, and
talked with me, saying: Come hither; I will show thee the bride,
the wife of the Lamb. <sup>10</sup>And he carried me away in the
spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city
Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, <sup>11</sup>having
the glory of God; her luminary like to a most precious stone, as it
were to a jasper stone, clear as crystal; <sup>12</sup>having a
wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve
angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the
twelve tribes of the sons of Israel; <sup>13</sup>on the east three
gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates,
and on the west three gates. <sup>14</sup>And the wall of the city
had twelve foundation-stones, and on them twelve names of the
twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>15</sup>And he who talked with me had a golden
reed for a measure, that he might measure the city, and the gates
thereof, and the wall thereof. <sup>16</sup>And the city lies
foursquare, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he
measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The
length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And he measured the wall thereof, a
hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, which is that
of an angel. <sup>18</sup>And the structure of its wall was jasper;
and the city was pure gold, like to pure glass. <sup>19</sup>The
foundation-stones of the wall of the city were adorned with every
precious stone. The first foundation-stone was jasper; the second,
sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
<sup>20</sup>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth,
chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
<sup>21</sup>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each several
gate was of one pearl; and the street of the city was pure gold, as
transparent glass.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>22</sup>And I saw in it no temple; for the Lord
God the Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>23</sup>And the city has no need of the sun,
neither of the moon, to shine on it; for the glory of God lightened
it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. <sup>24</sup>And the nations
will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their
glory into it. <sup>25</sup>And its gates will not be shut by day;
for there will be no night there; <sup>26</sup>and they will bring
the glory and the honor of the nations into it. <sup>27</sup>And
there shall not enter into it any thing unclean, or that works
abomination or falsehood; but they who are written in the Lamb's
book of life.</p>
<p class="pch"><span class=
"dc2">XXII.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A<span class="sc">nd</span> he showed
me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of
the throne of God and of the Lamb. <sup>2</sup>In the midst of its
street, and on either side of the river, was a tree of life,
bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit every month; and the
leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
<sup>3</sup>And there will be no more curse. And the throne of God
and of the Lamb will be in it; and his servants will serve him,
<sup>4</sup>and will see his face, and his name will be upon their
foreheads. <sup>5</sup>And there will be no night there; and they
will have no need of a lamp, nor of the light of the sun, because
the Lord God will give them light; and they will reign forever and
ever.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>6</sup>And he said to me: These sayings are
faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the
prophets, sent his angel to show to his servants what things must
shortly come to pass. <sup>7</sup>Behold, I come quickly. Happy is
he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>8</sup>And I, John, am he who heard and saw
these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship
before the feet of the angel, who showed me these things.
<sup>9</sup>And he says to me: See thou do it not. I am a
fellow-servant of thee and of thy brethren the prophets, and of
those who keep the sayings of this book; worship God.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>10</sup>And he says to me: Seal not the sayings
of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
<sup>11</sup>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he
that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous,
let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy
still.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>12</sup>Behold, I come quickly; and my reward
is with me, to give to each one according as his work is.
<sup>13</sup>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last,
the beginning and the end. <sup>14</sup>Happy are they who wash
their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may
enter by the gates into the city. <sup>15</sup>without are the
dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers,
and the idolaters, and every one that loves and makes a lie.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>16</sup>I, Jesus, sent my angel, to testify to
you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring
of David, the bright, the morning star.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>17</sup>And the Spirit and the bride say: Come.
And let him that hears say: Come. And let him that thirsts, come;
let him that will, take the water of life freely.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>18</sup>I testify to every one that hears the
words of the prophecy of this book, if any one shall add to them,
God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book;
<sup>19</sup>and if any one shall take away from the words of the
book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of
life, and out of the holy city, which are written of in this
book.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>20</sup>He who testifies these things, says:
Yea, I come quickly. Amen; come, Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin"><sup>21</sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the
saints.</p>
